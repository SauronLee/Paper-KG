Point, Disambiguate and Copy: Incorporating Bilingual Dictionaries for Neural Machine Translation | Tong Zhang | this paper proposes a sophisticated neural architecture to incorporate bilingual dictionaries into neural machine translation \( nmt \) models. by introducing three novel components: pointer , disambiguator , and copier , our method pdc achieves the following merits inherently compared with previous efforts: \( 1 \) pointer leverages the semantic information from bilingual dictionaries , for the first time , to better locate source words whose translation in dictionaries can potentially be used; \( 2 \) disambiguator synthesizes contextual information from the source view and the target view , both of which contribute to distinguishing the proper translation of a specific source word from multiple candidates in dictionaries; \( 3 \) copier systematically connects pointer and disambiguator based on a hierarchical copy mechanism seamlessly integrated with transformer , thereby building an end-to-end architecture that could avoid error propagation problems in alternative pipe-line methods. the experimental results on chinese-english and english-japanese benchmarks demonstrate the pdcâ€™s overall superiority and effectiveness of each component.
