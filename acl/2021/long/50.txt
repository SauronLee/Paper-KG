Structurizing Misinformation Stories via Rationalizing Fact-Checks | Shan Jiang | misinformation has recently become a well-documented matter of public concern. existing studies on this topic have hitherto adopted a coarse concept of misinformation , which incorporates a broad spectrum of story types ranging from political conspiracies to misinterpreted pranks. this paper aims to structurize these misinformation stories by leveraging fact-check articles. our intuition is that key phrases in a fact-check article that identify the misinformation type \( s \) \( e.g. , doctored images , urban legends \) also act as rationales that determine the verdict of the fact-check \( e.g. , false \) . we experiment on rationalized models with domain knowledge as weak supervision to extract these phrases as rationales , and then cluster semantically similar rationales to summarize prevalent misinformation types. using archived fact-checks from snopes.com , we identify ten types of misinformation stories. we discuss how these types have evolved over the last ten years and compare their prevalence between the 2016/2020 us presidential elections and the h1n1/covid-19 pandemics.
