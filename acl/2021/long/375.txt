Knowledge-Enriched Event Causality Identification via Latent Structure Induction Networks | Pengfei Cao | identifying causal relations of events is an important task in natural language processing area. however , the task is very challenging , because event causality is usually expressed in diverse forms that often lack explicit causal clues. existing methods cannot handle well the problem , especially in the condition of lacking training data. nonetheless , humans can make a correct judgement based on their background knowledge , including descriptive knowledge and relational knowledge. inspired by it , we propose a novel latent structure induction network \( lsin \) to incorporate the external structural knowledge into this task. specifically , to make use of the descriptive knowledge , we devise a descriptive graph induction module to obtain and encode the graph-structured descriptive knowledge. to leverage the relational knowledge , we propose a relational graph induction module which is able to automatically learn a reasoning structure for event causality reasoning. experimental results on two widely used datasets indicate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
