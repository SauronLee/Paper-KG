Neural Stylistic Response Generation with Disentangled Latent Variables | Qingfu Zhu | generating open-domain conversational responses in the desired style usually suffers from the lack of parallel data in the style. meanwhile , using monolingual stylistic data to increase style intensity often leads to the expense of decreasing content relevance. in this paper , we propose to disentangle the content and style in latent space by diluting sentence-level information in style representations. combining the desired style representation and a response content representation will then obtain a stylistic response. our approach achieves a higher bert-based style intensity score and comparable bleu scores , compared with baselines. human evaluation results show that our approach significantly improves style intensity and maintains content relevance.
