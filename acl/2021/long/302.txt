ABCD: A Graph Framework to Convert Complex Sentences to a Covering Set of Simple Sentences | Yanjun Gao | atomic clauses are fundamental text units for understanding complex sentences. identifying the atomic sentences within complex sentences is important for applications such as summarization , argument mining , discourse analysis , discourse parsing , and question answering. previous work mainly relies on rule-based methods dependent on parsing. we propose a new task to decompose each complex sentence into simple sentences derived from the tensed clauses in the source , and a novel problem formulation as a graph edit task. our neural model learns to accept , break , copy or drop elements of a graph that combines word adjacency and grammatical dependencies. the full processing pipeline includes modules for graph construction , graph editing , and sentence generation from the output graph. we introduce desse , a new dataset designed to train and evaluate complex sentence decomposition , and minwiki , a subset of minwikisplit. abcd achieves comparable performance as two parsing baselines on minwiki. on desse , which has a more even balance of complex sentence types , our model achieves higher accuracy on the number of atomic sentences than an encoder-decoder baseline. results include a detailed error analysis.
