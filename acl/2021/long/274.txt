Nested Named Entity Recognition via Explicitly Excluding the Influence of the Best Path | Yiran Wang | this paper presents a novel method for nested named entity recognition. as a layered method , our method extends the prior second-best path recognition method by explicitly excluding the influence of the best path. our method maintains a set of hidden states at each time step and selectively leverages them to build a different potential function for recognition at each level. in addition , we demonstrate that recognizing innermost entities first results in better performance than the conventional outermost entities first scheme. we provide extensive experimental results on ace2004 , ace2005 , and genia datasets to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.
