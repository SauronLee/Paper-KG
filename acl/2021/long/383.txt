Generating SOAP Notes from Doctor-Patient Conversations Using Modular Summarization Techniques | Kundan Krishna | following each patient visit , physicians draft long semi-structured clinical summaries called soap notes. while invaluable to clinicians and researchers , creating digital soap notes is burdensome , contributing to physician burnout. in this paper , we introduce the first complete pipelines to leverage deep summarization models to generate these notes based on transcripts of conversations between physicians and patients. after exploring a spectrum of methods across the extractive-abstractive spectrum , we propose cluster2sent , an algorithm that \( i \) extracts important utterances relevant to each summary section; \( ii \) clusters together related utterances; and then \( iii \) generates one summary sentence per cluster. cluster2sent outperforms its purely abstractive counterpart by 8 rouge-1 points , and produces significantly more factual and coherent sentences as assessed by expert human evaluators. for reproducibility , we demonstrate similar benefits on the publicly available ami dataset. our results speak to the benefits of structuring summaries into sections and annotating supporting evidence when constructing summarization corpora.
