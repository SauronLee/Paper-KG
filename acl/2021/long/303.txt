Which Linguist Invented the Lightbulb? Presupposition Verification for Question-Answering | Najoung Kim | many question-answering \( qa \) datasets contain unanswerable questions , but their treatment in qa systems remains primitive. our analysis of the natural questions \( kwiatkowski et al. 2019 \) dataset reveals that a substantial portion of unanswerable questions \( ~21% \) can be explained based on the presence of unverifiable presuppositions. through a user preference study , we demonstrate that the oracle behavior of our proposed system—which provides responses based on presupposition failure—is preferred over the oracle behavior of existing qa systems. then , we present a novel framework for implementing such a system in three steps: presupposition generation , presupposition verification , and explanation generation , reporting progress on each. finally , we show that a simple modification of adding presuppositions and their verifiability to the input of a competitive end-to-end qa system yields modest gains in qa performance and unanswerability detection , demonstrating the promise of our approach.
