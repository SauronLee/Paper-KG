Comparing Test Sets with Item Response Theory | Clara Vania | recent years have seen numerous nlp datasets introduced to evaluate the performance of fine-tuned models on natural language understanding tasks. recent results from large pretrained models , though , show that many of these datasets are largely saturated and unlikely to be able to detect further progress. what kind of datasets are still effective at discriminating among strong models , and what kind of datasets should we expect to be able to detect future improvements \? to measure this uniformly across datasets , we draw on item response theory and evaluate 29 datasets using predictions from 18 pretrained transformer models on individual test examples. we find that quoref , hellaswag , and mc-taco are best suited for distinguishing among state-of-the-art models , while snli , mnli , and commitmentbank seem to be saturated for current strong models. we also observe span selection task format , which is used for qa datasets like qamr or squad2.0 , is effective in differentiating between strong and weak models.
