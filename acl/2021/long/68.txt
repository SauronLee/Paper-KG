Learning Faithful Representations of Causal Graphs | Ananth Balashankar | learning contextual text embeddings that represent causal graphs has been useful in improving the performance of downstream tasks like causal treatment effect estimation. however , existing causal embeddings which are trained to predict direct causal links , fail to capture other indirect causal links of the graph , thus leading to spurious correlations in downstream tasks. in this paper , we define the faithfulness property of contextual embeddings to capture geometric distance-based properties of directed acyclic causal graphs. by incorporating these faithfulness properties , we learn text embeddings that are 31.3% more faithful to human validated causal graphs with about 800k and 200k causal links and achieve 21.1% better precision-recall auc in a link prediction fine-tuning task. further , in a crowdsourced causal question-answering task on yahoo ! answers with questions of the form “what causes x \? ” , our faithful embeddings achieved a precision of the first ranked answer \( p@1 \) of 41.07% , outperforming the existing baseline by 10.2%.
