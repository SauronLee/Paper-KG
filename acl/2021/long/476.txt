xMoCo: Cross Momentum Contrastive Learning for Open-Domain Question Answering | Nan Yang | dense passage retrieval has been shown to be an effective approach for information retrieval tasks such as open domain question answering. under this paradigm , a dual-encoder model is learned to encode questions and passages separately into vector representations , and all the passage vectors are then pre-computed and indexed , which can be efficiently retrieved by vector space search during inference time. in this paper , we propose a new contrastive learning method called cross momentum contrastive learning \( xmoco \) , for learning a dual-encoder model for question-passage matching. our method efficiently maintains a large pool of negative samples like the original moco , and by jointly optimizing question-to-passage and passage-to-question matching tasks , enables using separate encoders for questions and passages. we evaluate our method on various open-domain question answering dataset , and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
