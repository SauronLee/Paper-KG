A Systematic Investigation of KB-Text Embedding Alignment at Scale | Vardaan Pahuja | knowledge bases \( kbs \) and text often contain complementary knowledge: kbs store structured knowledge that can support long range reasoning , while text stores more comprehensive and timely knowledge in an unstructured way. separately embedding the individual knowledge sources into vector spaces has demonstrated tremendous successes in encoding the respective knowledge , but how to jointly embed and reason with both knowledge sources to fully leverage the complementary information is still largely an open problem. we conduct a large-scale , systematic investigation of aligning kb and text embeddings for joint reasoning. we set up a novel evaluation framework with two evaluation tasks , few-shot link prediction and analogical reasoning , and evaluate an array of kb-text embedding alignment methods. we also demonstrate how such alignment can infuse textual information into kb embeddings for more accurate link prediction on emerging entities and events , using covid-19 as a case study.
