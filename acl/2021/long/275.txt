LearnDA: Learnable Knowledge-Guided Data Augmentation for Event Causality Identification | Xinyu Zuo | modern models for event causality identification \( eci \) are mainly based on supervised learning , which are prone to the data lacking problem. unfortunately , the existing nlp-related augmentation methods cannot directly produce available data required for this task. to solve the data lacking problem , we introduce a new approach to augment training data for event causality identification , by iteratively generating new examples and classifying event causality in a dual learning framework. on the one hand , our approach is knowledge guided , which can leverage existing knowledge bases to generate well-formed new sentences. on the other hand , our approach employs a dual mechanism , which is a learnable augmentation framework , and can interactively adjust the generation process to generate task-related sentences. experimental results on two benchmarks eventstoryline and causal-timebank show that 1 \) our method can augment suitable task-related training data for eci; 2 \) our method outperforms previous methods on eventstoryline and causal-timebank \( +2.5 and +2.1 points on f1 value respectively \) .
