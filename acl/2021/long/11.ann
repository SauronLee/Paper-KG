T7	Definitions 316 604	the overwhelming majority of the slots in each turn should simply inherit the slot values from the previous turn. therefore , the mechanism of treating slots equally in each turn not only is inefficient but also may lead to additional errors because of the redundant slot value generation

T11	Definitions 802 1142	the dual slot selector determines each slot whether to update slot value or to inherit the slot value from the previous turn from two aspects: \( 1 \) if there is a strong relationship between it and the current turn dialogue utterances; \( 2 \) if a slot value with high reliability can be obtained for it through the current turn dialogue
R8	Attributes Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9	
T12	Definitions 1144 1335	the slots selected to be updated are permitted to enter the slot value generator to update values by a hybrid method , while the other slots directly inherit the values from the previous turn
