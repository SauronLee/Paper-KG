BoB: BERT Over BERT for Training Persona-based Dialogue Models from Limited Personalized Data | Haoyu Song | maintaining a consistent persona is essential for dialogue agents. although tremendous advancements have been brought , the limited-scale of annotated personalized dialogue datasets is still a barrier towards training robust and consistent persona-based dialogue models. this work shows how this challenge can be addressed by disentangling persona-based dialogue generation into two sub-tasks with a novel bert-over-bert \( bob \) model. specifically , the model consists of a bert-based encoder and two bert-based decoders , where one decoder is for response generation , and another is for consistency understanding. in particular , to learn the ability of consistency understanding from large-scale non-dialogue inference data , we train the second decoder in an unlikelihood manner. under different limited data settings , both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms strong baselines in response quality and persona consistency.
