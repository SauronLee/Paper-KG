T5	Evaluations 914 1053	we are able to generate paraphrases with a better tradeoff between semantic preservation and syntactic novelty compared to previous methods
T6	Methods 422 566	reconstruct a question from a paraphrase with the same meaning and an exemplar with the same surface form , leading to separated encoding spaces
T7	Models 397 418	encoder-decoder model
R4	Base Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6	
T8	Definitions 568 857	we use a vector-quantized variational autoencoder to represent the surface form as a set of discrete latent variables , allowing us to use a classifier to select a different surface form at test time. crucially , our method does not require access to an external source of target exemplars
