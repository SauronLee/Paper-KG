ExCAR: Event Graph Knowledge Enhanced Explainable Causal Reasoning | Li Du | prior work infers the causation between events mainly based on the knowledge induced from the annotated causal event pairs. however , additional evidence information intermediate to the cause and effect remains unexploited. by incorporating such information , the logical law behind the causality can be unveiled , and the interpretability and stability of the causal reasoning system can be improved. to facilitate this , we present an
