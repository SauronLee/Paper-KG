Joint Biomedical Entity and Relation Extraction with Knowledge-Enhanced Collective Inference | Tuan Lai | compared to the general news domain , information extraction \( ie \) from biomedical text requires much broader domain knowledge. however , many previous ie methods do not utilize any external knowledge during inference. due to the exponential growth of biomedical publications , models that do not go beyond their fixed set of parameters will likely fall behind. inspired by how humans look up relevant information to comprehend a scientific text , we present a novel framework that utilizes external knowledge for joint entity and relation extraction named keci \( knowledge-enhanced collective inference \) . given an input text , keci first constructs an initial span graph representing its initial understanding of the text. it then uses an entity linker to form a knowledge graph containing relevant background knowledge for the the entity mentions in the text. to make the final predictions , keci fuses the initial span graph and the knowledge graph into a more refined graph using an attention mechanism. keci takes a collective approach to link mention spans to entities by integrating global relational information into local representations using graph convolutional networks. our experimental results show that the framework is highly effective , achieving new state-of-the-art results in two different benchmark datasets: biorelex \( binding interaction detection \) and ade \( adverse drug event extraction \) . for example , keci achieves absolute improvements of 4.59% and 4.91% in f1 scores over the state-of-the-art on the biorelex entity and relation extraction tasks
