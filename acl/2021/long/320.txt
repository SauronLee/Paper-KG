Reliability Testing for Natural Language Processing Systems | Samson Tan | questions of fairness , robustness , and transparency are paramount to address before deploying nlp systems. central to these concerns is the question of reliability: can nlp systems reliably treat different demographics fairly and function correctly in diverse and noisy environments \? to address this , we argue for the need for reliability testing and contextualize it among existing work on improving accountability. we show how adversarial attacks can be reframed for this goal , via a framework for developing reliability tests. we argue that reliability testing — with an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration — will enable rigorous and targeted testing , and aid in the enactment and enforcement of industry standards.
