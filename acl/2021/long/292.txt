TextSETTR: Few-Shot Text Style Extraction and Tunable Targeted Restyling | Parker Riley | we present a novel approach to the problem of text style transfer. unlike previous approaches requiring style-labeled training data , our method makes use of readily-available unlabeled text by relying on the implicit connection in style between adjacent sentences , and uses labeled data only at inference time. we adapt t5 \( raffel et al. , 2020 \) , a strong pretrained text-to-text model , to extract a style vector from text and use it to condition the decoder to perform style transfer. as our label-free training results in a style vector space encoding many facets of style , we recast transfers as “targeted restyling” vector operations that adjust specific attributes of the input while preserving others. we demonstrate that training on unlabeled amazon reviews data results in a model that is competitive on sentiment transfer , even compared to models trained fully on labeled data. furthermore , applying our novel method to a diverse corpus of unlabeled web text results in a single model capable of transferring along multiple dimensions of style \( dialect , emotiveness , formality , politeness , sentiment \) despite no additional training and using only a handful of exemplars at inference time.
