CLIP: A Dataset for Extracting Action Items for Physicians from Hospital Discharge Notes | James Mullenbach | continuity of care is crucial to ensuring positive health outcomes for patients discharged from an inpatient hospital setting , and improved information sharing can help. to share information , caregivers write discharge notes containing action items to share with patients and their future caregivers , but these action items are easily lost due to the lengthiness of the documents. in this work , we describe our creation of a dataset of clinical action items annotated over mimic-iii , the largest publicly available dataset of real clinical notes. this dataset , which we call clip , is annotated by physicians and covers 718 documents representing 100k sentences. we describe the task of extracting the action items from these documents as multi-aspect extractive summarization , with each aspect representing a type of action to be taken. we evaluate several machine learning models on this task , and show that the best models exploit in-domain language model pre-training on 59k unannotated documents , and incorporate context from neighboring sentences. we also propose an approach to pre-training data selection that allows us to explore the trade-off between size and domain-specificity of pre-training datasets for this task.
