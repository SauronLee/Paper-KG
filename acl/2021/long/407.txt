Obtaining Better Static Word Embeddings Using Contextual Embedding Models | Prakhar Gupta | the advent of contextual word embeddings — representations of words which incorporate semantic and syntactic information from their context—has led to tremendous improvements on a wide variety of nlp tasks. however , recent contextual models have prohibitively high computational cost in many use-cases and are often hard to interpret. in this work , we demonstrate that our proposed distillation method , which is a simple extension of cbow-based training , allows to significantly improve computational efficiency of nlp applications , while outperforming the quality of existing static embeddings trained from scratch as well as those distilled from previously proposed methods. as a side-effect , our approach also allows a fair comparison of both contextual and static embeddings via standard lexical evaluation tasks.
