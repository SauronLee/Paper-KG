I like fish, especially dolphins: Addressing Contradictions in Dialogue Modeling | Yixin Nie | to quantify how well natural language understanding models can capture consistency in a general conversation , we introduce the dialogue contradiction detection task \( decode \) and a new conversational dataset containing both human-human and human-bot contradictory dialogues. we show that: \( i \) our newly collected dataset is notably more effective at providing supervision for the dialogue contradiction detection task than existing nli data including those aimed to cover the dialogue domain; \( ii \) transformer models that explicitly hinge on utterance structures for dialogue contradiction detection are more robust and generalize well on both analysis and out-of-distribution dialogues than standard \( unstructured \) transformers. we also show that our best contradiction detection model correlates well with human judgments and further provide evidence for its usage in both automatically evaluating and improving the consistency of state-of-the-art generative chatbots.
