Compare to The Knowledge: Graph Neural Fake News Detection with External Knowledge | Linmei Hu | nowadays , fake news detection , which aims to verify whether a news document is trusted or fake , has become urgent and important. most existing methods rely heavily on linguistic and semantic features from the news content , and fail to effectively exploit external knowledge which could help determine whether the news document is trusted. in this paper , we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural model called comparenet , which compares the news to the knowledge base \( kb \) through entities for fake news detection. considering that fake news detection is correlated with topics , we also incorporate topics to enrich the news representation. specifically , we first construct a
