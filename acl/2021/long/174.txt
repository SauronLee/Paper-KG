SMURF: SeMantic and linguistic UndeRstanding Fusion for Caption Evaluation via Typicality Analysis | Joshua Feinglass | the open-ended nature of visual captioning makes it a challenging area for evaluation. the majority of proposed models rely on specialized training to improve human-correlation , resulting in limited adoption , generalizability , and explainabilty. we introduce “typicality” , a new formulation of evaluation rooted in information theory , which is uniquely suited for problems lacking a definite ground truth. typicality serves as our framework to develop a novel semantic comparison , sparcs , as well as referenceless fluency evaluation metrics. over the course of our analysis , two separate dimensions of fluency naturally emerge: style , captured by metric spurts , and grammar , captured in the form of grammatical outlier penalties. through extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmark datasets , we show how these decomposed dimensions of semantics and fluency provide greater system-level insight into captioner differences. our proposed metrics along with their combination , smurf , achieve state-of-the-art correlation with human judgment when compared with other rule-based evaluation metrics.
