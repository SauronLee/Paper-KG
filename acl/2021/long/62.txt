Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition as Maximal Clique Discovery | Yucheng Wang | named entity recognition \( ner \) remains challenging when entity mentions can be discontinuous. existing methods break the recognition process into several sequential steps. in training , they predict conditioned on the golden intermediate results , while at inference relying on the model output of the previous steps , which introduces exposure bias. to solve this problem , we first construct a segment graph for each sentence , in which each node denotes a segment \( a continuous entity on its own , or a part of discontinuous entities \) , and an edge links two nodes that belong to the same entity. the nodes and edges can be generated respectively in one stage with a grid tagging scheme and learned jointly using a novel architecture named mac. then discontinuous ner can be reformulated as a non-parametric process of discovering maximal cliques in the graph and concatenating the spans in each clique. experiments on three benchmarks show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art \( sota \) results , with up to 3.5 percentage points improvement on f1 , and achieves 5x speedup over the sota model.
