Generating Query Focused Summaries from Query-Free Resources | Yumo Xu | the availability of large-scale datasets has driven the development of neural models that create generic summaries from single or multiple documents. in this work we consider query focused summarization \( qfs \) , a task for which training data in the form of queries , documents , and summaries is not readily available. we propose to decompose qfs into \( 1 \) query modeling \( i.e. , finding supportive evidence within a set of documents for a query \) and \( 2 \) conditional language modeling \( i.e. , summary generation \) . we introduce marge , a masked rouge regression framework for evidence estimation and ranking which relies on a unified representation for summaries and queries , so that summaries in generic data can be converted into proxy queries for learning a query model. experiments across qfs benchmarks and query types show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance despite learning from weak supervision.
