A Knowledge-Guided Framework for Frame Identification | Xuefeng Su | frame identification \( fi \) is a fundamental and challenging task in frame semantic parsing. the task aims to find the exact frame evoked by a target word in a given sentence. it is generally regarded as a classification task in existing work , where frames are treated as discrete labels or represented using onehot embeddings. however , the valuable knowledge about frames is neglected. in this paper , we propose a knowledge-guided frame identification framework \( kgfi \) that integrates three types frame knowledge , including frame definitions , frame elements and frame-to-frame relations , to learn better frame representation , which guides the kgfi to jointly map target words and frames into the same embedding space and subsequently identify the best frame by calculating the dot-product similarity scores between the target word embedding and all of the frame embeddings. the extensive experimental results demonstrate kgfi significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets.
