Matching Distributions between Model and Data: Cross-domain Knowledge Distillation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation | Bo Zhang | unsupervised domain adaptation \( uda \) aims to transfer the knowledge of source domain to the unlabeled target domain. existing methods typically require to learn to adapt the target model by exploiting the source data and sharing the network architecture across domains. however , this pipeline makes the source data risky and is inflexible for deploying the target model. this paper tackles a novel setting where only a trained source model is available and different network architectures can be adapted for target domain in terms of deployment environments. we propose a generic framework named
