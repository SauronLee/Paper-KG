UXLA: A Robust Unsupervised Data Augmentation Framework for Zero-Resource Cross-Lingual NLP | M Saiful Bari | transfer learning has yielded state-of-the-art \( sota \) results in many supervised nlp tasks. however , annotated data for every target task in every target language is rare , especially for low-resource languages. we propose uxla , a novel unsupervised data augmentation framework for zero-resource transfer learning scenarios. in particular , uxla aims to solve cross-lingual adaptation problems from a source language task distribution to an unknown target language task distribution , assuming no training label in the target language. at its core , uxla performs simultaneous self-training with data augmentation and unsupervised sample selection. to show its effectiveness , we conduct extensive experiments on three diverse zero-resource cross-lingual transfer tasks. uxla achieves sota results in all the tasks , outperforming the baselines by a good margin. with an in-depth framework dissection , we demonstrate the cumulative contributions of different components to its success.
