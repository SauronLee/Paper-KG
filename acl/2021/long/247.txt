Few-NERD: A Few-shot Named Entity Recognition Dataset | Ning Ding | recently , considerable literature has grown up around the theme of few-shot named entity recognition \( ner \) , but little published benchmark data specifically focused on the practical and challenging task. current approaches collect existing supervised ner datasets and re-organize them to the few-shot setting for empirical study. these strategies conventionally aim to recognize coarse-grained entity types with few examples , while in practice , most unseen entity types are fine-grained. in this paper , we present few-nerd , a large-scale human-annotated few-shot ner dataset with a hierarchy of 8 coarse-grained and 66 fine-grained entity types. few-nerd consists of 188 , 238 sentences from wikipedia , 4 , 601 , 160 words are included and each is annotated as context or a part of the two-level entity type. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first few-shot ner dataset and the largest human-crafted ner dataset. we construct benchmark tasks with different emphases to comprehensively assess the generalization capability of models. extensive empirical results and analysis show that few-nerd is challenging and the problem requires further research. the few-nerd dataset and the baselines will be publicly available to facilitate the research on this problem.
