Span-based Semantic Parsing for Compositional Generalization | Jonathan Herzig | despite the success of sequence-to-sequence \( seq2seq \) models in semantic parsing , recent work has shown that they fail in compositional generalization , i.e. , the ability to generalize to new structures built of components observed during training. in this work , we posit that a span-based parser should lead to better compositional generalization. we propose spanbasedsp , a parser that predicts a span tree over an input utterance , explicitly encoding how partial programs compose over spans in the input. spanbasedsp extends pasupat et al. \( 2019 \) to be comparable to seq2seq models by \( i \) training from programs , without access to gold trees , treating trees as latent variables , \( ii \) parsing a class of non-projective trees through an extension to standard cky. on geoquery , scan and closure datasets , spanbasedsp performs similarly to strong seq2seq baselines on random splits , but dramatically improves performance compared to baselines on splits that require compositional generalization: from 61.0 â†’ 88.9 average accuracy.
