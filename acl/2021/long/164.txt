COVID-Fact: Fact Extraction and Verification of Real-World Claims on COVID-19 Pandemic | Arkadiy Saakyan | we introduce a fever-like dataset covid-fact of 4 , 086 claims concerning the covid-19 pandemic. the dataset contains claims , evidence for the claims , and contradictory claims refuted by the evidence. unlike previous approaches , we automatically detect true claims and their source articles and then generate counter-claims using automatic methods rather than employing human annotators. along with our constructed resource , we formally present the task of identifying relevant evidence for the claims and verifying whether the evidence refutes or supports a given claim. in addition to scientific claims , our data contains simplified general claims from media sources , making it better suited for detecting general misinformation regarding covid-19. our experiments indicate that covid-fact will provide a challenging testbed for the development of new systems and our approach will reduce the costs of building domain-specific datasets for detecting misinformation.
