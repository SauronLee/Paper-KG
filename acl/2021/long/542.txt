Lexical Semantic Change Discovery | Sinan Kurtyigit | while there is a large amount of research in the field of lexical semantic change detection , only few approaches go beyond a standard benchmark evaluation of existing models. in this paper , we propose a shift of focus from change detection to change discovery , i.e. , discovering novel word senses over time from the full corpus vocabulary. by heavily fine-tuning a type-based and a token-based approach on recently published german data , we demonstrate that both models can successfully be applied to discover new words undergoing meaning change. furthermore , we provide an almost fully automated framework for both evaluation and discovery.
