Competence-based Multimodal Curriculum Learning for Medical Report Generation | Fenglin Liu | medical report generation task , which targets to produce long and coherent descriptions of medical images , has attracted growing research interests recently. different from the general image captioning tasks , medical report generation is more challenging for data-driven neural models. this is mainly due to 1 \) the serious data bias and 2 \) the limited medical data. to alleviate the data bias and make best use of available data , we propose a competence-based multimodal curriculum learning framework \( cmcl \) . specifically , cmcl simulates the learning process of radiologists and optimizes the model in a step by step manner. firstly , cmcl estimates the difficulty of each training instance and evaluates the competence of current model; secondly , cmcl selects the most suitable batch of training instances considering current model competence. by iterating above two steps , cmcl can gradually improve the modelâ€™s performance. the experiments on the public iu-xray and mimic-cxr datasets show that cmcl can be incorporated into existing models to improve their performance.
