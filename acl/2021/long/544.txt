Using Meta-Knowledge Mined from Identifiers to Improve Intent Recognition in Conversational Systems | Claudio Pinhanez | in this paper we explore the improvement of intent recognition in conversational systems by the use of meta-knowledge embedded in intent identifiers. developers often include such knowledge , structure as taxonomies , in the documentation of chatbots. by using neuro-symbolic algorithms to incorporate those taxonomies into embeddings of the output space , we were able to improve accuracy in intent recognition. in datasets with intents and example utterances from 200 professional chatbots , we saw decreases in the equal error rate \( eer \) in more than 40% of the chatbots in comparison to the baseline of the same algorithm without the meta-knowledge. the meta-knowledge proved also to be effective in detecting out-of-scope utterances , improving the false acceptance rate \( far \) in two thirds of the chatbots , with decreases of 0.05 or more in far in almost 40% of the chatbots. when considering only the well-developed workspaces with a high level use of taxonomies , far decreased more than 0.05 in 77% of them , and more than 0.1 in 39% of the chatbots.
