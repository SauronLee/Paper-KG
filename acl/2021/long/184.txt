Style is NOT a single variable: Case Studies for Cross-Stylistic Language Understanding | Dongyeop Kang | every natural text is written in some style. style is formed by a complex combination of different stylistic factors , including formality markers , emotions , metaphors , etc. one cannot form a complete understanding of a text without considering these factors. the factors combine and co-vary in complex ways to form styles. studying the nature of the covarying combinations sheds light on stylistic language in general , sometimes called cross-style language understanding. this paper provides the benchmark corpus \( xslue \) that combines existing datasets and collects a new one for sentence-level cross-style language understanding and evaluation. the benchmark contains text in 15 different styles under the proposed four theoretical groupings: figurative , personal , affective , and interpersonal groups. for valid evaluation , we collect an additional diagnostic set by annotating all 15 styles on the same text. using xslue , we propose three interesting cross-style applications in classification , correlation , and generation. first , our proposed cross-style classifier trained with multiple styles together helps improve overall classification performance against individually-trained style classifiers. second , our study shows that some styles are highly dependent on each other in human-written text. finally , we find that combinations of some contradictive styles likely generate stylistically less appropriate text. we believe our benchmark and case studies help explore interesting future directions for cross-style research. the preprocessed datasets and code are publicly available.
