Document-level Event Extraction via Heterogeneous Graph-based Interaction Model with a Tracker | Runxin Xu | document-level event extraction aims to recognize event information from a whole piece of article. existing methods are not effective due to two challenges of this task: a \) the target event arguments are scattered across sentences; b \) the correlation among events in a document is non-trivial to model. in this paper , we propose heterogeneous graph-based interaction model with a tracker \( git \) to solve the aforementioned two challenges. for the first challenge , git constructs a heterogeneous graph interaction network to capture global interactions among different sentences and entity mentions. for the second , git introduces a tracker module to track the extracted events and hence capture the interdependency among the events. experiments on a large-scale dataset \( zheng et al , 2019 \) show git outperforms the previous methods by 2.8 f1. further analysis reveals is effective in extracting multiple correlated events and event arguments that scatter across the document.
