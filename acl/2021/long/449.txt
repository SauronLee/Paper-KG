A Conditional Splitting Framework for Efficient Constituency Parsing | Thanh-Tung Nguyen | we introduce a generic seq2seq parsing framework that casts constituency parsing problems \( syntactic and discourse parsing \) into a series of conditional splitting decisions. our parsing model estimates the conditional probability distribution of possible splitting points in a given text span and supports efficient top-down decoding , which is linear in number of nodes. the conditional splitting formulation together with efficient beam search inference facilitate structural consistency without relying on expensive structured inference. crucially , for discourse analysis we show that in our formulation , discourse segmentation can be framed as a special case of parsing which allows us to perform discourse parsing without requiring segmentation as a pre-requisite. experiments show that our model achieves good results on the standard syntactic parsing tasks under settings with/without pre-trained representations and rivals state-of-the-art \( sota \) methods that are more computationally expensive than ours. in discourse parsing , our method outperforms sota by a good margin.
