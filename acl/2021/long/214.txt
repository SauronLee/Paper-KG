Interpretable and Low-Resource Entity Matching via Decoupling Feature Learning from Decision Making | Zijun Yao | entity matching \( em \) aims at recognizing entity records that denote the same real-world object. neural em models learn vector representation of entity descriptions and match entities end-to-end. though robust , these methods require many annotated resources for training , and lack of interpretability. in this paper , we propose a novel em framework that consists of heterogeneous information fusion \( hif \) and key attribute tree \( kat \) induction to decouple feature representation from matching decision. using self-supervised learning and mask mechanism in pre-trained language modeling , hif learns the embeddings of noisy attribute values by inter-attribute attention with unlabeled data. using a set of comparison features and a limited amount of annotated data , kat induction learns an efficient decision tree that can be interpreted by generating entity matching rules whose structure is advocated by domain experts. experiments on 6 public datasets and 3 industrial datasets show that our method is highly efficient and outperforms sota em models in most cases. we will release the codes upon acceptance.
