Surprisal Estimators for Human Reading Times Need Character Models | Byung-Doh Oh | while the use of character models has been popular in nlp applications , it has not been explored much in the context of psycholinguistic modeling. this paper presents a character model that can be applied to a structural parser-based processing model to calculate word generation probabilities. experimental results show that surprisal estimates from a structural processing model using this character model deliver substantially better fits to self-paced reading , eye-tracking , and fmri data than those from large-scale language models trained on much more data. this may suggest that the proposed processing model provides a more humanlike account of sentence processing , which assumes a larger role of morphology , phonotactics , and orthographic complexity than was previously thought.
