Transition-based Bubble Parsing: Improvements on Coordination Structure Prediction | Tianze Shi | we propose a transition-based bubble parser to perform coordination structure identification and dependency-based syntactic analysis simultaneously. bubble representations were proposed in the formal linguistics literature decades ago; they enhance dependency trees by encoding coordination boundaries and internal relationships within coordination structures explicitly. in this paper , we introduce a transition system and neural models for parsing these bubble-enhanced structures. experimental results on the english penn treebank and the english genia corpus show that our parsers beat previous state-of-the-art approaches on the task of coordination structure prediction , especially for the subset of sentences with complex coordination structures.
