Employing Argumentation Knowledge Graphs for Neural Argument Generation | Khalid Al Khatib | generating high-quality arguments , while being challenging , may benefit a wide range of downstream applications , such as writing assistants and argument search engines. motivated by the effectiveness of utilizing knowledge graphs for supporting general text generation tasks , this paper investigates the usage of argumentation-related knowledge graphs to control the generation of arguments. in particular , we construct and populate three knowledge graphs , employing several compositions of them to encode various knowledge into texts of debate portals and relevant paragraphs from wikipedia. then , the texts with the encoded knowledge are used to fine-tune a pre-trained text generation model , gpt-2. we evaluate the newly created arguments manually and automatically , based on several dimensions important in argumentative contexts , including argumentativeness and plausibility. the results demonstrate the positive impact of encoding the graphsâ€™ knowledge into debate portal texts for generating arguments with superior quality than those generated without knowledge.
