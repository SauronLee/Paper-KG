From Paraphrasing to Semantic Parsing: Unsupervised Semantic Parsing via Synchronous Semantic Decoding | Shan Wu | semantic parsing is challenging due to the structure gap and the semantic gap between utterances and logical forms. in this paper , we propose an unsupervised semantic parsing method - synchronous semantic decoding \( ssd \) , which can simultaneously resolve the semantic gap and the structure gap by jointly leveraging paraphrasing and grammar-constrained decoding. specifically , we reformulate semantic parsing as a constrained paraphrasing problem: given an utterance , our model synchronously generates its canonical utterancel and meaning representation. during synchronously decoding: the utterance paraphrasing is constrained by the structure of the logical form , therefore the canonical utterance can be paraphrased controlledly; the semantic decoding is guided by the semantics of the canonical utterance , therefore its logical form can be generated unsupervisedly. experimental results show that ssd is a promising approach and can achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised semantic parsing performance on multiple datasets.
