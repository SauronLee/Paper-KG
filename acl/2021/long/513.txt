Accelerating Text Communication via Abbreviated Sentence Input | Jiban Adhikary | typing every character in a text message may require more time or effort than strictly necessary. skipping spaces or other characters may be able to speed input and reduce a user’s physical input effort. this can be particularly important for people with motor impairments. in a large crowdsourced study , we found workers frequently abbreviated text by omitting mid-word vowels. we designed a recognizer optimized for expanding noisy abbreviated input where users often omit spaces and mid-word vowels. we show using neural language models for selecting conversational-style training text and for rescoring the recognizer’s n-best sentences improved accuracy. on noisy touchscreen data collected from hundreds of users , we found accurate abbreviated input was possible even if a third of characters was omitted. finally , in a study where users had to dwell for a second on each key , sentence abbreviated input was competitive with a conventional keyboard with word predictions. after practice , users wrote abbreviated sentences at 9.6 words-per-minute versus word input at 9.9 words-per-minute.
