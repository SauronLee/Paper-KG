A Neural Transition-based Model for Argumentation Mining | Jianzhu Bao | the goal of argumentation mining is to automatically extract argumentation structures from argumentative texts. most existing methods determine argumentative relations by exhaustively enumerating all possible pairs of argument components , which suffer from low efficiency and class imbalance. moreover , due to the complex nature of argumentation , there is , so far , no universal method that can address both tree and non-tree structured argumentation. towards these issues , we propose a neural transition-based model for argumentation mining , which incrementally builds an argumentation graph by generating a sequence of actions , avoiding inefficient enumeration operations. furthermore , our model can handle both tree and non-tree structured argumentation without introducing any structural constraints. experimental results show that our model achieves the best performance on two public datasets of different structures.
