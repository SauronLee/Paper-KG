BASS: Boosting Abstractive Summarization with Unified Semantic Graph | Wenhao Wu | abstractive summarization for long-document or multi-document remains challenging for the seq2seq architecture , as seq2seq is not good at analyzing long-distance relations in text. in this paper , we present bass , a novel framework for boosting abstractive summarization based on a unified semantic graph , which aggregates co-referent phrases distributing across a long range of context and conveys rich relations between phrases. further , a graph-based encoder-decoder model is proposed to improve both the document representation and summary generation process by leveraging the graph structure. specifically , several graph augmentation methods are designed to encode both the explicit and implicit relations in the text while the graph-propagation attention mechanism is developed in the decoder to select salient content into the summary. empirical results show that the proposed architecture brings substantial improvements for both long-document and multi-document summarization tasks.
