A Survey of Race, Racism, and Anti-Racism in NLP | Anjalie Field | despite inextricable ties between race and language , little work has considered race in nlp research and development. in this work , we survey 79 papers from the acl anthology that mention race. these papers reveal various types of race-related bias in all stages of nlp model development , highlighting the need for proactive consideration of how nlp systems can uphold racial hierarchies. however , persistent gaps in research on race and nlp remain: race has been siloed as a niche topic and remains ignored in many nlp tasks; most work operationalizes race as a fixed single-dimensional variable with a ground-truth label , which risks reinforcing differences produced by historical racism; and the voices of historically marginalized people are nearly absent in nlp literature. by identifying where and how nlp literature has and has not considered race , especially in comparison to related fields , our work calls for inclusion and racial justice in nlp research practices.
