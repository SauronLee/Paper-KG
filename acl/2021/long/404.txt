Lower Perplexity is Not Always Human-Like | Tatsuki Kuribayashi | in computational psycholinguistics , various language models have been evaluated against human reading behavior \( e.g. , eye movement \) to build human-like computational models. however , most previous efforts have focused almost exclusively on english , despite the recent trend towards linguistic universal within the general community. in order to fill the gap , this paper investigates whether the established results in computational psycholinguistics can be generalized across languages. specifically , we re-examine an established generalization â€”
