Unified Dual-view Cognitive Model for Interpretable Claim Verification | Lianwei Wu | recent studies constructing direct interactions between the claim and each single user response \( a comment or a relevant article \) to capture evidence have shown remarkable success in interpretable claim verification. owing to different single responses convey different cognition of individual users \( i.e. , audiences \) , the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of individual cognition. however , individualsâ€™ cognition of social things is not always able to truly reflect the objective. there may be one-sided or biased semantics in their opinions on a claim. the captured evidence correspondingly contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments , deteriorating task performance. in this paper , we propose a dual-view model based on the views of collective and individual cognition \( cicd \) for interpretable claim verification. from the view of the collective cognition , we not only capture the word-level semantics based on individual users , but also focus on sentence-level semantics \( i.e. , the overall responses \) among all users and adjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. from the view of individual cognition , we select the top-
