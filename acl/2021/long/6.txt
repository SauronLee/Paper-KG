PENS: A Dataset and Generic Framework for Personalized News Headline Generation | Xiang Ao | in this paper , we formulate the personalized news headline generation problem whose goal is to output a user-specific title based on both a userâ€™s reading interests and a candidate news body to be exposed to her. to build up a benchmark for this problem , we publicize a large-scale dataset named pens \( personalized news headlines \) . the training set is collected from user impressions logs of microsoft news , and the test set is manually created by hundreds of native speakers to enable a fair testbed for evaluating models in an offline mode. we propose a generic framework as a preparatory solution to our problem. at its heart , user preference is learned by leveraging the user behavioral data , and three kinds of user preference injections are proposed to personalize a text generator and establish personalized headlines. we investigate our dataset by implementing several state-of-the-art user modeling methods in our framework to demonstrate a benchmark score for the proposed dataset. the dataset is available at https://msnews.github.io/pens.html.
