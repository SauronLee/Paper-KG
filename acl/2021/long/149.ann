T3	Issues 93 255	natural language processing \( nlp \) systems learn harmful societal biases that cause them to amplify inequality as they are deployed in more and more situations
T4	Methods 382 553	some of these metrics are intrinsic , measuring bias in word embedding spaces , and some are extrinsic , measuring bias in downstream tasks that the word embeddings enable

T5	Issues 555 621	do these intrinsic and extrinsic metrics correlate with each other
T6	Theories 756 873	our results show no reliable correlation between these metrics that holds in all scenarios across tasks and languages
T7	Methods 625 754	we compare intrinsic and extrinsic metrics across hundreds of trained models covering different tasks and experimental conditions
