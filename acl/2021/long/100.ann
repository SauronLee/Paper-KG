T1	Titles 0 71	Improving Zero-Shot Translation by Disentangling Positional Information
T2	Persons 74 83	Danni Liu
T3	Sectors 86 125	multilingual neural machine translation
T4	Definitions 136 245	the capability of directly translating between language pairs unseen in training , i.e. zero-shot translation
R1	Attributes Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3	
T5	Issues 287 327	it often suffers from low output quality
T6	Issues 329 485	the difficulty of generalizing to new translation directions suggests the model representations are highly specific to those language pairs seen in training
R2	Challenges Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3	
R3	Challenges Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3	
T7	Theories 487 615	we demonstrate that a main factor causing the language-specific representations is the positional correspondence to input tokens
R4	Contributions Arg1:T7 Arg2:T1	
R5	Solution Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6	
R6	Solution Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5	
T8	Evaluations 739 843	we gain up to 18.5 bleu points on zero-shot translation while retaining quality on supervised directions
R7	Result Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7	
T9	Theories 1096 1233	by thorough inspections of the hidden layer outputs , we show that our approach indeed leads to more language-independent representations
R8	Result Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7	
R9	Contributions Arg1:T9 Arg2:T1
