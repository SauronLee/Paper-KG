Learn to Resolve Conversational Dependency: A Consistency Training Framework for Conversational Question Answering | Gangwoo Kim | one of the main challenges in conversational question answering \( cqa \) is to resolve the conversational dependency , such as anaphora and ellipsis. however , existing approaches do not explicitly train qa models on how to resolve the dependency , and thus these models are limited in understanding human dialogues. in this paper , we propose a novel framework , excord \( explicit guidance on how to resolve conversational dependency \) to enhance the abilities of qa models in comprehending conversational context. excord first generates self-contained questions that can be understood without the conversation history , then trains a qa model with the pairs of original and self-contained questions using a consistency-based regularizer. in our experiments , we demonstrate that excord significantly improves the qa modelsâ€™ performance by up to 1.2 f1 on quac , and 5.2 f1 on canard , while addressing the limitations of the existing approaches.
