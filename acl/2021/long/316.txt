Check It Again:Progressive Visual Question Answering via Visual Entailment | Qingyi Si | while sophisticated neural-based models have achieved remarkable success in visual question answering \( vqa \) , these models tend to answer questions only according to superficial correlations between question and answer. several recent approaches have been developed to address this language priors problem. however , most of them predict the correct answer according to one best output without checking the authenticity of answers. besides , they only explore the interaction between image and question , ignoring the semantics of candidate answers. in this paper , we propose a select-and-rerank \( sar \) progressive framework based on visual entailment. specifically , we first select the candidate answers relevant to the question or the image , then we rerank the candidate answers by a visual entailment task , which verifies whether the image semantically entails the synthetic statement of the question and each candidate answer. experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework , which establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy on vqa-cp v2 with a 7.55% improvement.
