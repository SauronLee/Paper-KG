GTM: A Generative Triple-wise Model for Conversational Question Generation | Lei Shen | generating some appealing questions in open-domain conversations is an effective way to improve human-machine interactions and lead the topic to a broader or deeper direction. to avoid dull or deviated questions , some researchers tried to utilize answer , the “future” information , to guide question generation. however , they separate a post-question-answer \( pqa \) triple into two parts: post-question \( pq \) and question-answer \( qa \) pairs , which may hurt the overall coherence. besides , the qa relationship is modeled as a one-to-one mapping that is not reasonable in open-domain conversations. to tackle these problems , we propose a generative triple-wise model with hierarchical variations for open-domain conversational question generation \( cqg \) . latent variables in three hierarchies are used to represent the shared background of a triple and one-to-many semantic mappings in both pq and qa pairs. experimental results on a large-scale cqg dataset show that our method significantly improves the quality of questions in terms of fluency , coherence and diversity over competitive baselines.
