Locate and Label: A Two-stage Identifier for Nested Named Entity Recognition | Yongliang Shen | named entity recognition \( ner \) is a well-studied task in natural language processing. traditional ner research only deals with flat entities and ignores nested entities. the span-based methods treat entity recognition as a span classification task. although these methods have the innate ability to handle nested ner , they suffer from high computational cost , ignorance of boundary information , under-utilization of the spans that partially match with entities , and difficulties in long entity recognition. to tackle these issues , we propose a two-stage entity identifier. first we generate span proposals by filtering and boundary regression on the seed spans to locate the entities , and then label the boundary-adjusted span proposals with the corresponding categories. our method effectively utilizes the boundary information of entities and partially matched spans during training. through boundary regression , entities of any length can be covered theoretically , which improves the ability to recognize long entities. in addition , many low-quality seed spans are filtered out in the first stage , which reduces the time complexity of inference. experiments on nested ner datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.
