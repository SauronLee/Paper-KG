Improving Named Entity Recognition by External Context Retrieving and Cooperative Learning | Xinyu Wang | recent advances in named entity recognition \( ner \) show that document-level contexts can significantly improve model performance. in many application scenarios , however , such contexts are not available. in this paper , we propose to find external contexts of a sentence by retrieving and selecting a set of semantically relevant texts through a search engine , with the original sentence as the query. we find empirically that the contextual representations computed on the retrieval-based input view , constructed through the concatenation of a sentence and its external contexts , can achieve significantly improved performance compared to the original input view based only on the sentence. furthermore , we can improve the model performance of both input views by cooperative learning , a training method that encourages the two input views to produce similar contextual representations or output label distributions. experiments show that our approach can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 8 ner data sets across 5 domains.
