AdaTag: Multi-Attribute Value Extraction from Product Profiles with Adaptive Decoding | Jun Yan | automatic extraction of product attribute values is an important enabling technology in e-commerce platforms. this task is usually modeled using sequence labeling architectures , with several extensions to handle multi-attribute extraction. one line of previous work constructs attribute-specific models , through separate decoders or entirely separate models. however , this approach constrains knowledge sharing across different attributes. other contributions use a single multi-attribute model , with different techniques to embed attribute information. but sharing the entire network parameters across all attributes can limit the modelâ€™s capacity to capture attribute-specific characteristics. in this paper we present adatag , which uses adaptive decoding to handle extraction. we parameterize the decoder with pretrained attribute embeddings , through a hypernetwork and a mixture-of-experts \( moe \) module. this allows for separate , but semantically correlated , decoders to be generated on the fly for different attributes. this approach facilitates knowledge sharing , while maintaining the specificity of each attribute. our experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset show marked improvements over previous methods.
