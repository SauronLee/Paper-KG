Exploring the Representation of Word Meanings in Context: A Case Study on Homonymy and Synonymy | Marcos Garcia | this paper presents a multilingual study of word meaning representations in context. we assess the ability of both static and contextualized models to adequately represent different lexical-semantic relations , such as homonymy and synonymy. to do so , we created a new multilingual dataset that allows us to perform a controlled evaluation of several factors such as the impact of the surrounding context or the overlap between words , conveying the same or different senses. a systematic assessment on four scenarios shows that the best monolingual models based on transformers can adequately disambiguate homonyms in context. however , as they rely heavily on context , these models fail at representing words with different senses when occurring in similar sentences. experiments are performed in galician , portuguese , english , and spanish , and both the dataset \( with more than 3 , 000 evaluation items \) and new models are freely released with this study.
