COINS: Dynamically Generating COntextualized Inference Rules for Narrative Story Completion | Debjit Paul | despite recent successes of large pre-trained language models in solving reasoning tasks , their inference capabilities remain opaque. we posit that such models can be made more interpretable by explicitly generating interim inference rules , and using them to guide the generation of task-specific textual outputs. in this paper we present coins , a recursive inference framework that i \) iteratively reads context sentences , ii \) dynamically generates contextualized inference rules , encodes them , and iii \) uses them to guide task-specific output generation. we apply to a
