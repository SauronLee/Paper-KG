Named Entity Recognition with Small Strongly Labeled and Large Weakly Labeled Data | Haoming Jiang | weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language processing tasks , such as named entity recognition \( ner \) . existing work mainly focuses on learning deep ner models only with weak supervision , i.e. , without any human annotation , and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data , one can achieve good performance , though still underperforms fully supervised ner with manually/strongly labeled data. in this paper , we consider a more practical scenario , where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data and a large amount of weakly labeled data. unfortunately , we observe that weakly labeled data does not necessarily improve , or even deteriorate the model performance \( due to the extensive noise in the weak labels \) when we train deep ner models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and weakly labeled data. to address this issue , we propose a new multi-stage computational framework â€“ needle with three essential ingredients: \( 1 \) weak label completion , \( 2 \) noise-aware loss function , and \( 3 \) final fine-tuning over the strongly labeled data. through experiments on e-commerce query ner and biomedical ner , we demonstrate that needle can effectively suppress the noise of the weak labels and outperforms existing methods. in particular , we achieve new sota f1-scores on 3 biomedical ner datasets: bc5cdr-chem 93.74 , bc5cdr-disease 90.69 , ncbi-disease 92.28.
