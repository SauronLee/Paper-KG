Few-Shot Text Ranking with Meta Adapted Synthetic Weak Supervision | Si Sun | the effectiveness of neural information retrieval \( neu-ir \) often depends on a large scale of in-domain relevance training signals , which are not always available in real-world ranking scenarios. to democratize the benefits of neu-ir , this paper presents metaadaptrank , a domain adaptive learning method that generalizes neu-ir models from label-rich source domains to few-shot target domains. drawing on source-domain massive relevance supervision , metaadaptrank contrastively synthesizes a large number of weak supervision signals for target domains and meta-learns to reweight these synthetic “weak” data based on their benefits to the target-domain ranking accuracy of neu-ir models. experiments on three trec benchmarks in the web , news , and biomedical domains show that metaadaptrank significantly improves the few-shot ranking accuracy of neu-ir models. further analyses indicate that metaadaptrank thrives from both its contrastive weak data synthesis and meta-reweighted data selection. the code and data of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/metaadaptrank.
