PlotCoder: Hierarchical Decoding for Synthesizing Visualization Code in Programmatic Context | Xinyun Chen | creating effective visualization is an important part of data analytics. while there are many libraries for creating visualization , writing such code remains difficult given the myriad of parameters that users need to provide. in this paper , we propose the new task of synthesizing visualization programs from a combination of natural language utterances and code context. to tackle the learning problem , we introduce plotcoder , a new hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture that models both the code context and the input utterance. we use plotcoder to first determine the template of the visualization code , followed by predicting the data to be plotted. we use jupyter notebooks containing visualization programs crawled from github to train plotcoder. on a comprehensive set of test samples from those notebooks , we show that plotcoder correctly predicts the plot type of about 70% samples , and synthesizes the correct programs for 35% samples , performing 3-4.5% better than the baselines.
