T5	Methods 307 687	\( i \) explore the semantic interaction between the claim and evidence at different granularity levels but fail to capture their topical consistency during the reasoning process , which we believe is crucial for verification; \( ii \) aggregate multiple pieces of evidence equally without considering their implicit stances to the claim , thereby introducing spurious information
