How Did This Get Funded?! Automatically Identifying Quirky Scientific Achievements | Chen Shani | humor is an important social phenomenon , serving complex social and psychological functions. however , despite being studied for millennia humor is computationally not well understood , often considered an ai-complete problem. in this work , we introduce a novel setting in humor mining: automatically detecting funny and unusual scientific papers. we are inspired by the ig nobel prize , a satirical prize awarded annually to celebrate funny scientific achievements \( example past winner: “are cows more likely to lie down the longer they stand \? ” \) . this challenging task has unique characteristics that make it particularly suitable for automatic learning. we construct a dataset containing thousands of funny papers and use it to learn classifiers , combining findings from psychology and linguistics with recent advances in nlp. we use our models to identify potentially funny papers in a large dataset of over 630 , 000 articles. the results demonstrate the potential of our methods , and more broadly the utility of integrating state-of-the-art nlp methods with insights from more traditional disciplines
