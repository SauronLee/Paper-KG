Towards User-Driven Neural Machine Translation | Huan Lin | a good translation should not only translate the original content semantically , but also incarnate personal traits of the original text. for a real-world neural machine translation \( nmt \) system , these user traits \( e.g. , topic preference , stylistic characteristics and expression habits \) can be preserved in user behavior \( e.g. , historical inputs \) . however , current nmt systems marginally consider the user behavior due to: 1 \) the difficulty of modeling user portraits in zero-shot scenarios , and 2 \) the lack of user-behavior annotated parallel dataset. to fill this gap , we introduce a novel framework called user-driven nmt. specifically , a cache-based module and a user-driven contrastive learning method are proposed to offer nmt the ability to capture potential user traits from their historical inputs under a zero-shot learning fashion. furthermore , we contribute the first chinese-english parallel corpus annotated with user behavior called udt-corpus. experimental results confirm that the proposed user-driven nmt can generate user-specific translations.
