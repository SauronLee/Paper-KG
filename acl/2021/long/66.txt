Bilingual Lexicon Induction via Unsupervised Bitext Construction and Word Alignment | Haoyue Shi | bilingual lexicons map words in one language to their translations in another , and are typically induced by learning linear projections to align monolingual word embedding spaces. in this paper , we show it is possible to produce much higher quality lexicons with methods that combine \( 1 \) unsupervised bitext mining and \( 2 \) unsupervised word alignment. directly applying a pipeline that uses recent algorithms for both subproblems significantly improves induced lexicon quality and further gains are possible by learning to filter the resulting lexical entries , with both unsupervised and semi-supervised schemes. our final model outperforms the state of the art on the bucc 2020 shared task by 14 f1 points averaged over 12 language pairs , while also providing a more interpretable approach that allows for rich reasoning of word meaning in context. further analysis of our output and the standard reference lexicons suggests they are of comparable quality , and new benchmarks may be needed to measure further progress on this task.
