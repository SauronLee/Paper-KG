Reasoning over Entity-Action-Location Graph for Procedural Text Understanding | Hao Huang | procedural text understanding aims at tracking the states \( e.g. , create , move , destroy \) and locations of the entities mentioned in a given paragraph. to effectively track the states and locations , it is essential to capture the rich semantic relations between entities , actions , and locations in the paragraph. although recent works have achieved substantial progress , most of them focus on leveraging the inherent constraints or incorporating external knowledge for state prediction. the rich semantic relations in the given paragraph are largely overlooked. in this paper , we propose a novel approach \( real \) to procedural text understanding , where we build a general framework to systematically model the entity-entity , entity-action , and entity-location relations using a graph neural network. we further develop algorithms for graph construction , representation learning , and state and location tracking. we evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark datasets , propara , and recipes. the experimental results show that our method outperforms strong baselines by a large margin , i.e. , 5.0% on propara and 3.2% on recipes , illustrating the utility of semantic relations and the effectiveness of the graph-based reasoning model.
