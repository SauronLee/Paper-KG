A Span-Based Model for Joint Overlapped and Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition | Fei Li | research on overlapped and discontinuous named entity recognition \( ner \) has received increasing attention. the majority of previous work focuses on either overlapped or discontinuous entities. in this paper , we propose a novel span-based model that can recognize both overlapped and discontinuous entities jointly. the model includes two major steps. first , entity fragments are recognized by traversing over all possible text spans , thus , overlapped entities can be recognized. second , we perform relation classification to judge whether a given pair of entity fragments to be overlapping or succession. in this way , we can recognize not only discontinuous entities , and meanwhile doubly check the overlapped entities. as a whole , our model can be regarded as a relation extraction paradigm essentially. experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets \( i.e. , clef , genia and ace05 \) show that our model is highly competitive for overlapped and discontinuous ner.
