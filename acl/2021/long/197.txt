LGESQL: Line Graph Enhanced Text-to-SQL Model with Mixed Local and Non-Local Relations | Ruisheng Cao | this work aims to tackle the challenging heterogeneous graph encoding problem in the text-to-sql task. previous methods are typically node-centric and merely utilize different weight matrices to parameterize edge types , which 1 \) ignore the rich semantics embedded in the topological structure of edges , and 2 \) fail to distinguish local and non-local relations for each node. to this end , we propose a line graph enhanced text-to-sql \( lgesql \) model to mine the underlying relational features without constructing meta-paths. by virtue of the line graph , messages propagate more efficiently through not only connections between nodes , but also the topology of directed edges. furthermore , both local and non-local relations are integrated distinctively during the graph iteration. we also design an auxiliary task called graph pruning to improve the discriminative capability of the encoder. our framework achieves state-of-the-art results \( 62.8% with glove , 72.0% with electra \) on the cross-domain text-to-sql benchmark spider at the time of writing.
