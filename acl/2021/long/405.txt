Word Sense Disambiguation: Towards Interactive Context Exploitation from Both Word and Sense Perspectives | Ming Wang | lately proposed word sense disambiguation \( wsd \) systems have approached the estimated upper bound of the task on standard evaluation benchmarks. however , these systems typically implement the disambiguation of words in a document almost independently , underutilizing sense and word dependency in context. in this paper , we convert the nearly isolated decisions into interrelated ones by exposing senses in context when learning sense embeddings in a similarity-based sense aware context exploitation \( sace \) architecture. meanwhile , we enhance the context embedding learning with selected sentences from the same document , rather than utilizing only the sentence where each ambiguous word appears. experiments on both english and multilingual wsd datasets have shown the effectiveness of our approach , surpassing previous state-of-the-art by large margins \( 3.7% and 1.2% respectively \) , especially on few-shot \( 14.3% \) and zero-shot \( 35.9% \) scenarios.
