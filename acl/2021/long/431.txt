Crowdsourcing Learning as Domain Adaptation: A Case Study on Named Entity Recognition | Xin Zhang | crowdsourcing is regarded as one prospective solution for effective supervised learning , aiming to build large-scale annotated training data by crowd workers. previous studies focus on reducing the influences from the noises of the crowdsourced annotations for supervised models. we take a different point in this work , regarding all crowdsourced annotations as gold-standard with respect to the individual annotators. in this way , we find that crowdsourcing could be highly similar to domain adaptation , and then the recent advances of cross-domain methods can be almost directly applied to crowdsourcing. here we take named entity recognition \( ner \) as a study case , suggesting an annotator-aware representation learning model that inspired by the domain adaptation methods which attempt to capture effective domain-aware features. we investigate both unsupervised and supervised crowdsourcing learning , assuming that no or only small-scale expert annotations are available. experimental results on a benchmark crowdsourced ner dataset show that our method is highly effective , leading to a new state-of-the-art performance. in addition , under the supervised setting , we can achieve impressive performance gains with only a very small scale of expert annotations.
