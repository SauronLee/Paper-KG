A Sequence-to-Sequence Approach to Dialogue State Tracking | Yue Feng | this paper is concerned with dialogue state tracking \( dst \) in a task-oriented dialogue system. building a dst module that is highly effective is still a challenging issue , although significant progresses have been made recently. this paper proposes a new approach to dialogue state tracking , referred to as seq2seq-du , which formalizes dst as a sequence-to-sequence problem. seq2seq-du employs two bert-based encoders to respectively encode the utterances in the dialogue and the descriptions of schemas , an attender to calculate attentions between the utterance embeddings and the schema embeddings , and a decoder to generate pointers to represent the current state of dialogue. seq2seq-du has the following advantages. it can jointly model intents , slots , and slot values; it can leverage the rich representations of utterances and schemas based on bert; it can effectively deal with categorical and non-categorical slots , and unseen schemas. in addition , seq2seq-du can also be used in the nlu \( natural language understanding \) module of a dialogue system. experimental results on benchmark datasets in different settings \( sgd , multiwoz2.2 , multiwoz2.1 , woz2.0 , dstc2 , m2m , snips , and atis \) show that seq2seq-du outperforms the existing methods.
