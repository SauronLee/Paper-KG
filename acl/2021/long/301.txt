W-RST: Towards a Weighted RST-style Discourse Framework | Patrick Huber | aiming for a better integration of data-driven and linguistically-inspired approaches , we explore whether rst nuclearity , assigning a binary assessment of importance between text segments , can be replaced by automatically generated , real-valued scores , in what we call a weighted-rst framework. in particular , we find that weighted discourse trees from auxiliary tasks can benefit key nlp downstream applications , compared to nuclearity-centered approaches. we further show that real-valued importance distributions partially and interestingly align with the assessment and uncertainty of human annotators.
