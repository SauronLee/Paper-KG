A Unified Generative Framework for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis | Hang Yan | aspect-based sentiment analysis \( absa \) aims to identify the aspect terms , their corresponding sentiment polarities , and the opinion terms. there exist seven subtasks in absa. most studies only focus on the subsets of these subtasks , which leads to various complicated absa models while hard to solve these subtasks in a unified framework. in this paper , we redefine every subtask target as a sequence mixed by pointer indexes and sentiment class indexes , which converts all absa subtasks into a unified generative formulation. based on the unified formulation , we exploit the pre-training sequence-to-sequence model bart to solve all absa subtasks in an end-to-end framework. extensive experiments on four absa datasets for seven subtasks demonstrate that our framework achieves substantial performance gain and provides a real unified end-to-end solution for the whole absa subtasks , which could benefit multiple tasks.
