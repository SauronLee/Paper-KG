Bad Seeds: Evaluating Lexical Methods for Bias Measurement | Maria Antoniak | a common factor in bias measurement methods is the use of hand-curated seed lexicons , but there remains little guidance for their selection. we gather seeds used in prior work , documenting their common sources and rationales , and in case studies of three english-language corpora , we enumerate the different types of social biases and linguistic features that , once encoded in the seeds , can affect subsequent bias measurements. seeds developed in one context are often re-used in other contexts , but documentation and evaluation remain necessary precursors to relying on seeds for sensitive measurements.
