Structured Sentiment Analysis as Dependency Graph Parsing | Jeremy Barnes | structured sentiment analysis attempts to extract full opinion tuples from a text , but over time this task has been subdivided into smaller and smaller sub-tasks , e.g. , target extraction or targeted polarity classification. we argue that this division has become counterproductive and propose a new unified framework to remedy the situation. we cast the structured sentiment problem as dependency graph parsing , where the nodes are spans of sentiment holders , targets and expressions , and the arcs are the relations between them. we perform experiments on five datasets in four languages \( english , norwegian , basque , and catalan \) and show that this approach leads to strong improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. our analysis shows that refining the sentiment graphs with syntactic dependency information further improves results.
