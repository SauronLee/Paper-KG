Exploring Dynamic Selection of Branch Expansion Orders for Code Generation | Hui Jiang | due to the great potential in facilitating software development , code generation has attracted increasing attention recently. generally , dominant models are seq2tree models , which convert the input natural language description into a sequence of tree-construction actions corresponding to the pre-order traversal of an abstract syntax tree \( ast \) . however , such a traversal order may not be suitable for handling all multi-branch nodes. in this paper , we propose to equip the seq2tree model with a context-based branch selector , which is able to dynamically determine optimal expansion orders of branches for multi-branch nodes. particularly , since the selection of expansion orders is a non-differentiable multi-step operation , we optimize the selector through reinforcement learning , and formulate the reward function as the difference of model losses obtained through different expansion orders. experimental results and in-depth analysis on several commonly-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach. we have released our code at https://github.com/deeplearnxmu/cg-rl.
