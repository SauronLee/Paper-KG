From Discourse to Narrative: Knowledge Projection for Event Relation Extraction | Jialong Tang | current event-centric knowledge graphs highly rely on explicit connectives to mine relations between events. unfortunately , due to the sparsity of connectives , these methods severely undermine the coverage of eventkgs. the lack of high-quality labelled corpora further exacerbates that problem. in this paper , we propose a knowledge projection paradigm for event relation extraction: projecting discourse knowledge to narratives by exploiting the commonalities between them. specifically , we propose multi-tier knowledge projection network \( mkpnet \) , which can leverage multi-tier discourse knowledge effectively for event relation extraction. in this way , the labelled data requirement is significantly reduced , and implicit event relations can be effectively extracted. intrinsic experimental results show that mkpnet achieves the new state-of-the-art performance and extrinsic experimental results verify the value of the extracted event relations.
