PhotoChat: A Human-Human Dialogue Dataset With Photo Sharing Behavior For Joint Image-Text Modeling | Xiaoxue Zang | we present a new human-human dialogue dataset - photochat , the first dataset that casts light on the photo sharing behavior in online messaging. photochat contains 12k dialogues , each of which is paired with a user photo that is shared during the conversation. based on this dataset , we propose two tasks to facilitate research on image-text modeling: a photo-sharing intent prediction task that predicts whether one intends to share a photo in the next conversation turn , and a photo retrieval task that retrieves the most relevant photo according to the dialogue context. in addition , for both tasks , we provide baseline models using the state-of-the-art models and report their benchmark performances. the best image retrieval model achieves 10.4% recall@1 \( out of 1000 candidates \) and the best photo intent prediction model achieves 58.1% f1 score , indicating that the dataset presents interesting yet challenging real-world problems. we are releasing photochat to facilitate future research work among the community.
