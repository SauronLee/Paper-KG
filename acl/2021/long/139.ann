T6	Issues 235 531	existing work mainly focuses on learning deep ner models only with weak supervision , i.e. , without any human annotation , and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data , one can achieve good performance , though still underperforms fully supervised ner with manually/strongly labeled data.
