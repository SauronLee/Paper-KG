Discovering Dialog Structure Graph for Coherent Dialog Generation | Jun Xu | learning discrete dialog structure graph from human-human dialogs yields basic insights into the structure of conversation , and also provides background knowledge to facilitate dialog generation. however , this problem is less studied in open-domain dialogue. in this paper , we conduct unsupervised discovery of discrete dialog structure from chitchat corpora , and then leverage it to facilitate coherent dialog generation in downstream systems. to this end , we present an unsupervised model , discrete variational auto-encoder with graph neural network \( dvae-gnn \) , to discover discrete hierarchical latent dialog states \( at the level of both session and utterance \) and their transitions from corpus as a dialog structure graph. then we leverage it as background knowledge to facilitate dialog management in a rl based dialog system. experimental results on two benchmark corpora confirm that dvae-gnn can discover meaningful dialog structure graph , and the use of dialog structure as background knowledge can significantly improve multi-turn coherence.
