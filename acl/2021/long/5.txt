DeepRapper: Neural Rap Generation with Rhyme and Rhythm Modeling | Lanqing Xue | rap generation , which aims to produce lyrics and corresponding singing beats , needs to model both rhymes and rhythms. previous works for rap generation focused on rhyming lyrics , but ignored rhythmic beats , which are important for rap performance. in this paper , we develop deeprapper , a transformer-based rap generation system that can model both rhymes and rhythms. since there is no available rap datasets with rhythmic beats , we develop a data mining pipeline to collect a large-scale rap dataset , which includes a large number of rap songs with aligned lyrics and rhythmic beats. second , we design a transformer-based autoregressive language model which carefully models rhymes and rhythms. specifically , we generate lyrics in the reverse order with rhyme representation and constraint for rhyme enhancement , and insert a beat symbol into lyrics for rhythm/beat modeling. to our knowledge , deeprapper is the first system to generate rap with both rhymes and rhythms. both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that deeprapper generates creative and high-quality raps with rhymes and rhythms.
