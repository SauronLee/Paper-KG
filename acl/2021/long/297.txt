Label-Specific Dual Graph Neural Network for Multi-Label Text Classification | Qianwen Ma | multi-label text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. previous studies have difficulties to distinguish similar labels well because they learn the same document representations for different labels , that is they do not explicitly extract label-specific semantic components from documents. moreover , they do not fully explore the high-order interactions among these semantic components , which is very helpful to predict tail labels. in this paper , we propose a novel label-specific dual graph neural network \( ldgn \) , which incorporates category information to learn label-specific components from documents , and employs dual graph convolution network \( gcn \) to model complete and adaptive interactions among these components based on the statistical label co-occurrence and dynamic reconstruction graph in a joint way. experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ldgn significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models , and also achieves better performance with respect to tail labels.
