Detecting Propaganda Techniques in Memes | Dimitar Dimitrov | propaganda can be defined as a form of communication that aims to influence the opinions or the actions of people towards a specific goal; this is achieved by means of well-defined rhetorical and psychological devices. propaganda , in the form we know it today , can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th century. however , it is with the advent of the internet and the social media that propaganda has started to spread on a much larger scale than before , thus becoming major societal and political issue. nowadays , a large fraction of propaganda in social media is multimodal , mixing textual with visual content. with this in mind , here we propose a new multi-label multimodal task: detecting the type of propaganda techniques used in memes. we further create and release a new corpus of 950 memes , carefully annotated with 22 propaganda techniques , which can appear in the text , in the image , or in both. our analysis of the corpus shows that understanding both modalities together is essential for detecting these techniques. this is further confirmed in our experiments with several state-of-the-art multimodal models.
