T6	Definitions 400 522	includes 15 , 000 challenging perturbations and each hateful entry has fine-grained labels for the type and target of hate
T7	Definitions 524 623	hateful entries make up 54% of the dataset , which is substantially higher than comparable datasets

T8	Evaluations 625 944	we show that model performance is substantially improved using this approach. models trained on later rounds of data collection perform better on test sets and are harder for annotators to trick. they also have better performance on hatecheck , a suite of functional tests for online hate detection. we provide the code
