Keep It Simple: Unsupervised Simplification of Multi-Paragraph Text | Philippe Laban | this work presents keep it simple \( kis \) , a new approach to unsupervised text simplification which learns to balance a reward across three properties: fluency , salience and simplicity. we train the model with a novel algorithm to optimize the reward \( k-scst \) , in which the model proposes several candidate simplifications , computes each candidateâ€™s reward , and encourages candidates that outperform the mean reward. finally , we propose a realistic text comprehension task as an evaluation method for text simplification. when tested on the english news domain , the kis model outperforms strong supervised baselines by more than 4 sari points , and can help people complete a comprehension task an average of 18% faster while retaining accuracy , when compared to the original text.
