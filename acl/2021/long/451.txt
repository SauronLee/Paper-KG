An In-depth Study on Internal Structure of Chinese Words | Chen Gong | unlike english letters , chinese characters have rich and specific meanings. usually , the meaning of a word can be derived from its constituent characters in some way. several previous works on syntactic parsing propose to annotate shallow word-internal structures for better utilizing character-level information. this work proposes to model the deep internal structures of chinese words as dependency trees with 11 labels for distinguishing syntactic relationships. first , based on newly compiled annotation guidelines , we manually annotate a word-internal structure treebank \( wist \) consisting of over 30k multi-char words from chinese penn treebank. to guarantee quality , each word is independently annotated by two annotators and inconsistencies are handled by a third senior annotator. second , we present detailed and interesting analysis on wist to reveal insights on chinese word formation. third , we propose word-internal structure parsing as a new task , and conduct benchmark experiments using a competitive dependency parser. finally , we present two simple ways to encode word-internal structures , leading to promising gains on the sentence-level syntactic parsing task.
