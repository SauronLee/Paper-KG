OntoED: Low-resource Event Detection with Ontology Embedding | Shumin Deng | event detection \( ed \) aims to identify event trigger words from a given text and classify it into an event type. most current methods to ed rely heavily on training instances , and almost ignore the correlation of event types. hence , they tend to suffer from data scarcity and fail to handle new unseen event types. to address these problems , we formulate ed as a process of event ontology population: linking event instances to pre-defined event types in event ontology , and propose a novel ed framework entitled ontoed with ontology embedding. we enrich event ontology with linkages among event types , and further induce more event-event correlations. based on the event ontology , ontoed can leverage and propagate correlation knowledge , particularly from data-rich to data-poor event types. furthermore , ontoed can be applied to new unseen event types , by establishing linkages to existing ones. experiments indicate that ontoed is more predominant and robust than previous approaches to ed , especially in data-scarce scenarios.
