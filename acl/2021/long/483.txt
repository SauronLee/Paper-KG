SENT: Sentence-level Distant Relation Extraction via Negative Training | Ruotian Ma | distant supervision for relation extraction provides uniform bag labels for each sentence inside the bag , while accurate sentence labels are important for downstream applications that need the exact relation type. directly using bag labels for sentence-level training will introduce much noise , thus severely degrading performance. in this work , we propose the use of negative training \( nt \) , in which a model is trained using complementary labels regarding that “the instance does not belong to these complementary labels”. since the probability of selecting a true label as a complementary label is low , nt provides less noisy information. furthermore , the model trained with nt is able to separate the noisy data from the training data. based on nt , we propose a sentence-level framework , sent , for distant relation extraction. sent not only filters the noisy data to construct a cleaner dataset , but also performs a re-labeling process to transform the noisy data into useful training data , thus further benefiting the model’s performance. experimental results show the significant improvement of the proposed method over previous methods on sentence-level evaluation and de-noise effect.
