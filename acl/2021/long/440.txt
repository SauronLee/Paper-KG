DynaEval: Unifying Turn and Dialogue Level Evaluation | Chen Zhang | a dialogue is essentially a multi-turn interaction among interlocutors. effective evaluation metrics should reflect the dynamics of such interaction. existing automatic metrics are focused very much on the turn-level quality , while ignoring such dynamics. to this end , we propose dynaeval , a unified automatic evaluation framework which is not only capable of performing turn-level evaluation , but also holistically considers the quality of the entire dialogue. in dynaeval , the graph convolutional network \( gcn \) is adopted to model a dialogue in totality , where the graph nodes denote each individual utterance and the edges represent the dependency between pairs of utterances. a contrastive loss is then applied to distinguish well-formed dialogues from carefully constructed negative samples. experiments show that dynaeval significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art dialogue coherence model , and correlates strongly with human judgements across multiple dialogue evaluation aspects at both turn and dialogue level.
