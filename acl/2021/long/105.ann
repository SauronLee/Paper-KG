T9	Definitions 578 724	this is arguably a more important extension as a larger proportion of decoded trees will not be subject to the root constraint of dependency trees
R6	Attributes Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8	
T10	Theories 735 864	we show that the rate of root constraint violations increases by an average of 13 times when decoding with k=50 as opposed to k=1
