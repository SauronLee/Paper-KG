Poisoning Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Relation Inference Patterns | Peru Bhardwaj | we study the problem of generating data poisoning attacks against knowledge graph embedding \( kge \) models for the task of link prediction in knowledge graphs. to poison kge models , we propose to exploit their inductive abilities which are captured through the relationship patterns like symmetry , inversion and composition in the knowledge graph. specifically , to degrade the model’s prediction confidence on target facts , we propose to improve the model’s prediction confidence on a set of decoy facts. thus , we craft adversarial additions that can improve the model’s prediction confidence on decoy facts through different inference patterns. our experiments demonstrate that the proposed poisoning attacks outperform state-of-art baselines on four kge models for two publicly available datasets. we also find that the symmetry pattern based attacks generalize across all model-dataset combinations which indicates the sensitivity of kge models to this pattern.
