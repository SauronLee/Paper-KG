Capturing Event Argument Interaction via A Bi-Directional Entity-Level Recurrent Decoder | Xi Xiangyu | capturing interactions among event arguments is an essential step towards robust event argument extraction \( eae \) . however , existing efforts in this direction suffer from two limitations: 1 \) the argument role type information of contextual entities is mainly utilized as training signals , ignoring the potential merits of directly adopting it as semantically rich input features; 2 \) the argument-level sequential semantics , which implies the overall distribution pattern of argument roles over an event mention , is not well characterized. to tackle the above two bottlenecks , we formalize eae as a seq2seq-like learning problem for the first time , where a sentence with a specific event trigger is mapped to a sequence of event argument roles. a neural architecture with a novel bi-directional entity-level recurrent decoder \( berd \) is proposed to generate argument roles by incorporating contextual entitiesâ€™ argument role predictions , like a word-by-word text generation process , thereby distinguishing implicit argument distribution patterns within an event more accurately.
