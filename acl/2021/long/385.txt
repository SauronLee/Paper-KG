Early Detection of Sexual Predators in Chats | Matthias Vogt | an important risk that children face today is online grooming , where a so-called sexual predator establishes an emotional connection with a minor online with the objective of sexual abuse. prior work has sought to automatically identify grooming chats , but only after an incidence has already happened in the context of legal prosecution. in this work , we instead investigate this problem from the point of view of prevention. we define and study the task of early sexual predator detection \( espd \) in chats , where the goal is to analyze a running chat from its beginning and predict grooming attempts as early and as accurately as possible. we survey existing datasets and their limitations regarding espd , and create a new dataset called panc for more realistic evaluations. we present strong baselines built on bert that also reach state-of-the-art results for conventional spd. finally , we consider coping with limited computational resources , as real-life applications require espd on mobile devices.
