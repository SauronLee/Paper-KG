A Survey of Code-switching: Linguistic and Social Perspectives for Language Technologies | A. Seza Doğruöz | the analysis of data in which multiple languages are represented has gained popularity among computational linguists in recent years. so far , much of this research focuses mainly on the improvement of computational methods and largely ignores linguistic and social aspects of c-s discussed across a wide range of languages within the long-established literature in linguistics. to fill this gap , we offer a survey of code-switching \( c-s \) covering the literature in linguistics with a reflection on the key issues in language technologies. from the linguistic perspective , we provide an overview of structural and functional patterns of c-s focusing on the literature from european and indian contexts as highly multilingual areas. from the language technologies perspective , we discuss how massive language models fail to represent diverse c-s types due to lack of appropriate training data , lack of robust evaluation benchmarks for c-s \( across multilingual situations and types of c-s \) and lack of end-to- end systems that cover sociolinguistic aspects of c-s as well. our survey will be a step to- wards an outcome of mutual benefit for computational scientists and linguists with a shared interest in multilingualism and c-s.
