UniRE: A Unified Label Space for Entity Relation Extraction | Yijun Wang | many joint entity relation extraction models setup two separated label spaces for the two sub-tasks \( i.e. , entity detection and relation classification \) . we argue that this setting may hinder the information interaction between entities and relations. in this work , we propose to eliminate the different treatment on the two sub-tasks’ label spaces. the input of our model is a table containing all word pairs from a sentence. entities and relations are represented by squares and rectangles in the table. we apply a unified classifier to predict each cell’s label , which unifies the learning of two sub-tasks. for testing , an effective \( yet fast \) approximate decoder is proposed for finding squares and rectangles from tables. experiments on three benchmarks \( ace04 , ace05 , scierc \) show that , using only half the number of parameters , our model achieves competitive accuracy with the best extractor , and is faster.
