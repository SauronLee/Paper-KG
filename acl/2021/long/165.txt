Explaining Relationships Between Scientific Documents | Kelvin Luu | we address the task of explaining relationships between two scientific documents using natural language text. this task requires modeling the complex content of long technical documents , deducing a relationship between these documents , and expressing the details of that relationship in text. in addition to the theoretical interest of this task , successful solutions can help improve researcher efficiency in search and review. in this paper we establish a dataset of 622k examples from 154k documents. we pretrain a large language model to serve as the foundation for autoregressive approaches to the task. we explore the impact of taking different views on the two documents , including the use of dense representations extracted with scientific ie systems. we provide extensive automatic and human evaluations which show the promise of such models , but make clear challenges for future work.
