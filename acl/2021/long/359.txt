Trigger is Not Sufficient: Exploiting Frame-aware Knowledge for Implicit Event Argument Extraction | Kaiwen Wei | implicit event argument extraction seeks to identify arguments that play direct or implicit roles in a given event. however , most prior works focus on capturing direct relations between arguments and the event trigger. the lack of reasoning ability brings many challenges to the extraction of implicit arguments. in this work , we present a frame-aware event argument extraction \( feae \) learning framework to tackle this issue through reasoning in event frame-level scope. the proposed method leverages related arguments of the expected one as clues to guide the reasoning process. to bridge the gap between oracle knowledge used in the training phase and the imperfect related arguments in the test stage , we further introduce a curriculum knowledge distillation strategy to drive a final model that could operate without extra inputs through mimicking the behavior of a well-informed teacher model. experimental results demonstrate feae obtains new state-of-the-art performance on the rams dataset.
