A Semantic-based Method for Unsupervised Commonsense Question Answering | Yilin Niu | unsupervised commonsense question answering is appealing since it does not rely on any labeled task data. among existing work , a popular solution is to use pre-trained language models to score candidate choices directly conditioned on the question or context. however , such scores from language models can be easily affected by irrelevant factors , such as word frequencies , sentence structures , etc. these distracting factors may not only mislead the model to choose a wrong answer but also make it oversensitive to lexical perturbations in candidate answers. in this paper , we present a novel semantic-based question answering method \( seqa \) for unsupervised commonsense question answering. instead of directly scoring each answer choice , our method first generates a set of plausible answers with generative models \( e.g. , gpt-2 \) , and then uses these plausible answers to select the correct choice by considering the semantic similarity between each plausible answer and each choice. we devise a simple , yet sound formalism for this idea and verify its effectiveness and robustness with extensive experiments. we evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets , and our method achieves the best results in unsupervised settings. moreover , when attacked by textfooler with synonym replacement , seqa demonstrates much less performance drops than baselines , thereby indicating stronger robustness.
