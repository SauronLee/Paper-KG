Improving Encoder by Auxiliary Supervision Tasks for Table-to-Text Generation | Liang Li | table-to-text generation aims at automatically generating natural text to help people conveniently obtain salient information in tables. although neural models for table-to-text have achieved remarkable progress , some problems are still overlooked. previous methods cannot deduce the factual results from the entityâ€™s \( player or team \) performance and the relations between entities. to solve this issue , we first build an entity graph from the input tables and introduce a reasoning module to perform reasoning on the graph. moreover , there are different relations \( e.g. , the numeric size relation and the importance relation \) between records in different dimensions. and these relations may contribute to the data-to-text generation. however , it is hard for a vanilla encoder to capture these. consequently , we propose to utilize two auxiliary tasks , number ranking \( nr \) and importance ranking \( ir \) , to supervise the encoder to capture the different relations. experimental results on rotowire and rw-fg show that our method not only has a good generalization but also outperforms previous methods on several metrics: bleu , content selection , content ordering.
