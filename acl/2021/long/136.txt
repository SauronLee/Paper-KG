Dialogue Response Selection with Hierarchical Curriculum Learning | Yixuan Su | we study the learning of a matching model for dialogue response selection. motivated by the recent finding that models trained with random negative samples are not ideal in real-world scenarios , we propose a hierarchical curriculum learning framework that trains the matching model in an “easy-to-difficult” scheme. our learning framework consists of two complementary curricula: \( 1 \) corpus-level curriculum \( cc \) ; and \( 2 \) instance-level curriculum \( ic \) . in cc , the model gradually increases its ability in finding the matching clues between the dialogue context and a response candidate. as for ic , it progressively strengthens the model’s ability in identifying the mismatching information between the dialogue context and a response candidate. empirical studies on three benchmark datasets with three state-of-the-art matching models demonstrate that the proposed learning framework significantly improves the model performance across various evaluation metrics.
