ILDC for CJPE: Indian Legal Documents Corpus for Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation | Vijit Malik | an automated system that could assist a judge in predicting the outcome of a case would help expedite the judicial process. for such a system to be practically useful , predictions by the system should be explainable. to promote research in developing such a system , we introduce ildc \( indian legal documents corpus \) . ildc is a large corpus of 35k indian supreme court cases annotated with original court decisions. a portion of the corpus \( a separate test set \) is annotated with gold standard explanations by legal experts. based on ildc , we propose the task of court judgment prediction and explanation \( cjpe \) . the task requires an automated system to predict an explainable outcome of a case. we experiment with a battery of baseline models for case predictions and propose a hierarchical occlusion based model for explainability. our best prediction model has an accuracy of 78% versus 94% for human legal experts , pointing towards the complexity of the prediction task. the analysis of explanations by the proposed algorithm reveals a significant difference in the point of view of the algorithm and legal experts for explaining the judgments , pointing towards scope for future research.
