A Training-free and Reference-free Summarization Evaluation Metric via Centrality-weighted Relevance and Self-referenced Redundancy | Wang Chen | in recent years , reference-based and supervised summarization evaluation metrics have been widely explored. however , collecting human-annotated references and ratings are costly and time-consuming. to avoid these limitations , we propose a training-free and reference-free summarization evaluation metric. our metric consists of a centrality-weighted relevance score and a self-referenced redundancy score. the relevance score is computed between the pseudo reference built from the source document and the given summary , where the pseudo reference content is weighted by the sentence centrality to provide importance guidance. besides an
