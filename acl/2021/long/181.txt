Tree-Structured Topic Modeling with Nonparametric Neural Variational Inference | Ziye Chen | topic modeling has been widely used for discovering the latent semantic structure of documents , but most existing methods learn topics with a flat structure. although probabilistic models can generate topic hierarchies by introducing nonparametric priors like chinese restaurant process , such methods have data scalability issues. in this study , we develop a tree-structured topic model by leveraging nonparametric neural variational inference. particularly , the latent components of the stick-breaking process are first learned for each document , then the affiliations of latent components are modeled by the dependency matrices between network layers. utilizing this network structure , we can efficiently extract a tree-structured topic hierarchy with reasonable structure , low redundancy , and adaptable widths. experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.
