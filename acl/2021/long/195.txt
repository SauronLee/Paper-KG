KACE: Generating Knowledge Aware Contrastive Explanations for Natural Language Inference | Qianglong Chen | in order to better understand the reason behind model behaviors \( i.e. , making predictions \) , most recent works have exploited generative models to provide complementary explanations. however , existing approaches in nlp mainly focus on “why a” rather than contrastive “why a not b” , which is shown to be able to better distinguish confusing candidates and improve data efficiency in other research fields.in this paper , we focus on generating contrastive explanations with counterfactual examples in nli and propose a novel
