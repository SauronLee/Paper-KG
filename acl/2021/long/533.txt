Are Missing Links Predictable? An Inferential Benchmark for Knowledge Graph Completion | Yixin Cao | we present inferwiki , a knowledge graph completion \( kgc \) dataset that improves upon existing benchmarks in inferential ability , assumptions , and patterns. first , each testing sample is predictable with supportive data in the training set. to ensure it , we propose to utilize rule-guided train/test generation , instead of conventional random split. second , inferwiki initiates the evaluation following the open-world assumption and improves the inferential difficulty of the closed-world assumption , by providing manually annotated negative and unknown triples. third , we include various inference patterns \( e.g. , reasoning path length and types \) for comprehensive evaluation. in experiments , we curate two settings of inferwiki varying in sizes and structures , and apply the construction process on codex as comparative datasets. the results and empirical analyses demonstrate the necessity and high-quality of inferwiki. nevertheless , the performance gap among various inferential assumptions and patterns presents the difficulty and inspires future research direction. our datasets can be found in https://github.com/taominer/inferwiki.
