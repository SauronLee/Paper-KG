Directed Acyclic Graph Network for Conversational Emotion Recognition | Weizhou Shen | the modeling of conversational context plays a vital role in emotion recognition from conversation \( erc \) . in this paper , we put forward a novel idea of encoding the utterances with a directed acyclic graph \( dag \) to better model the intrinsic structure within a conversation , and design a directed acyclic neural network , namely dag-erc , to implement this idea. in an attempt to combine the strengths of conventional graph-based neural models and recurrence-based neural models , dag-erc provides a more intuitive way to model the information flow between long-distance conversation background and nearby context. extensive experiments are conducted on four erc benchmarks with state-of-the-art models employed as baselines for comparison. the empirical results demonstrate the superiority of this new model and confirm the motivation of the directed acyclic graph architecture for erc.
