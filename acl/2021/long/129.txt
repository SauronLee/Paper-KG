Measuring Conversational Uptake: A Case Study on Student-Teacher Interactions | Dorottya Demszky | in conversation , uptake happens when a speaker builds on the contribution of their interlocutor by , for example , acknowledging , repeating or reformulating what they have said. in education , teachers’ uptake of student contributions has been linked to higher student achievement. yet measuring and improving teachers’ uptake at scale is challenging , as existing methods require expensive annotation by experts. we propose a framework for computationally measuring uptake , by \( 1 \) releasing a dataset of student-teacher exchanges extracted from us math classroom transcripts annotated for uptake by experts; \( 2 \) formalizing uptake as pointwise jensen-shannon divergence \( pjsd \) , estimated via next utterance classification; \( 3 \) conducting a linguistically-motivated comparison of different unsupervised measures and \( 4 \) correlating these measures with educational outcomes. we find that although repetition captures a significant part of uptake , pjsd outperforms repetition-based baselines , as it is capable of identifying a wider range of uptake phenomena like question answering and reformulation. we apply our uptake measure to three different educational datasets with outcome indicators. unlike baseline measures , pjsd correlates significantly with instruction quality in all three , providing evidence for its generalizability and for its potential to serve as an automated professional development tool for teachers.
