Value-Agnostic Conversational Semantic Parsing | Emmanouil Antonios Platanios | conversational semantic parsers map user utterances to executable programs given dialogue histories composed of previous utterances , programs , and system responses. existing parsers typically condition on rich representations of history that include the complete set of values and computations previously discussed. we propose a model that abstracts over values to focus prediction on type- and function-level context. this approach provides a compact encoding of dialogue histories and predicted programs , improving generalization and computational efficiency. our model incorporates several other components , including an atomic span copy operation and structural enforcement of well-formedness constraints on predicted programs , that are particularly advantageous in the low-data regime. trained on the smcalflow and treedst datasets , our model outperforms prior work by 7.3% and 10.6% respectively in terms of absolute accuracy. trained on only a thousand examples from each dataset , it outperforms strong baselines by 12.4% and 6.4%. these results indicate that simple representations are key to effective generalization in conversational semantic parsing.
