Beyond Sentence-Level End-to-End Speech Translation: Context Helps | Biao Zhang | document-level contextual information has shown benefits to text-based machine translation , but whether and how context helps end-to-end \( e2e \) speech translation \( st \) is still under-studied. we fill this gap through extensive experiments using a simple concatenation-based context-aware st model , paired with adaptive feature selection on speech encodings for computational efficiency. we investigate several decoding approaches , and introduce in-model ensemble decoding which jointly performs document- and sentence-level translation using the same model. our results on the must-c benchmark with transformer demonstrate the effectiveness of context to e2e st. compared to sentence-level st , context-aware st obtains better translation quality \( +0.18-2.61 bleu \) , improves pronoun and homophone translation , shows better robustness to \( artificial \) audio segmentation errors , and reduces latency and flicker to deliver higher quality for simultaneous translation.
