Unsupervised Extractive Summarization-Based Representations for Accurate and Explainable Collaborative Filtering | Reinald Adrian Pugoy | we pioneer the first extractive summarization-based collaborative filtering model called escofilt. our proposed model specifically produces extractive summaries for each item and user. unlike other types of explanations , summary-level explanations closely resemble real-life explanations. the strength of escofilt lies in the fact that it unifies representation and explanation. in other words , extractive summaries both represent and explain the items and users. our model uniquely integrates bert , k-means embedding clustering , and multilayer perceptron to learn sentence embeddings , representation-explanations , and user-item interactions , respectively. we argue that our approach enhances both rating prediction accuracy and user/item explainability. our experiments illustrate that escofiltâ€™s prediction accuracy is better than the other state-of-the-art recommender models. furthermore , we propose a comprehensive set of criteria that assesses the real-life explainability of explanations. our explainability study demonstrates the superiority of and preference for summary-level explanations over other explanation types.
