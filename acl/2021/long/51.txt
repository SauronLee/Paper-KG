Modeling Language Usage and Listener Engagement in Podcasts | Sravana Reddy | while there is an abundance of advice to podcast creators on how to speak in ways that engage their listeners , there has been little data-driven analysis of podcasts that relates linguistic style with engagement. in this paper , we investigate how various factors – vocabulary diversity , distinctiveness , emotion , and syntax , among others – correlate with engagement , based on analysis of the creators’ written descriptions and transcripts of the audio. we build models with different textual representations , and show that the identified features are highly predictive of engagement. our analysis tests popular wisdom about stylistic elements in high-engagement podcasts , corroborating some pieces of advice and adding new perspectives on others.
