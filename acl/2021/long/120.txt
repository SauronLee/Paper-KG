MECT: Multi-Metadata Embedding based Cross-Transformer for Chinese Named Entity Recognition | Shuang Wu | recently , word enhancement has become very popular for chinese named entity recognition \( ner \) , reducing segmentation errors and increasing the semantic and boundary information of chinese words. however , these methods tend to ignore the information of the chinese character structure after integrating the lexical information. chinese characters have evolved from pictographs since ancient times , and their structure often reflects more information about the characters. this paper presents a novel multi-metadata embedding based cross-transformer \( mect \) to improve the performance of chinese ner by fusing the structural information of chinese characters. specifically , we use multi-metadata embedding in a two-stream transformer to integrate chinese character features with the radical-level embedding. with the structural characteristics of chinese characters , mect can better capture the semantic information of chinese characters for ner. the experimental results obtained on several well-known benchmarking datasets demonstrate the merits and superiority of the proposed mect method.
