Human-in-the-Loop for Data Collection: a Multi-Target Counter Narrative Dataset to Fight Online Hate Speech | Margherita Fanton | undermining the impact of hateful content with informed and non-aggressive responses , called counter narratives , has emerged as a possible solution for having healthier online communities. thus , some nlp studies have started addressing the task of counter narrative generation. although such studies have made an effort to build hate speech / counter narrative \( hs/cn \) datasets for neural generation , they fall short in reaching either high-quality and/or high-quantity. in this paper , we propose a novel human-in-the-loop data collection methodology in which a generative language model is refined iteratively by using its own data from the previous loops to generate new training samples that experts review and/or post-edit. our experiments comprised several loops including diverse dynamic variations. results show that the methodology is scalable and facilitates diverse , novel , and cost-effective data collection. to our knowledge , the resulting dataset is the only expert-based multi-target hs/cn dataset available to the community.
