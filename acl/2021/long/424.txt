Article Reranking by Memory-Enhanced Key Sentence Matching for Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims | Qiang Sheng | false claims that have been previously fact-checked can still spread on social media. to mitigate their continual spread , detecting previously fact-checked claims is indispensable. given a claim , existing works focus on providing evidence for detection by reranking candidate fact-checking articles \( fc-articles \) retrieved by bm25. however , these performances may be limited because they ignore the following characteristics of fc-articles: \( 1 \) claims are often quoted to describe the checked events , providing lexical information besides semantics; \( 2 \) sentence templates to introduce or debunk claims are common across articles , providing pattern information. models that ignore the two aspects only leverage semantic relevance and may be misled by sentences that describe similar but irrelevant events. in this paper , we propose a novel reranker , mtm \( memory-enhanced transformers for matching \) to rank fc-articles using key sentences selected with event \( lexical and semantic \) and pattern information. for event information , we propose a rouge-guided transformer which is finetuned with regression of rouge. for pattern information , we generate pattern vectors for matching with sentences. by fusing event and pattern information , we select key sentences to represent an article and then predict if the article fact-checks the given claim using the claim , key sentences , and patterns. experiments on two real-world datasets show that mtm outperforms existing methods. human evaluation proves that mtm can capture key sentences for explanations.
