T10	Evaluations 713 984	extensive experiments are conducted on four erc benchmarks with state-of-the-art models employed as baselines for comparison. the empirical results demonstrate the superiority of this new model and confirm the motivation of the directed acyclic graph architecture for erc
T11	Definitions 461 711	in an attempt to combine the strengths of conventional graph-based neural models and recurrence-based neural models , dag-erc provides a more intuitive way to model the information flow between long-distance conversation background and nearby context
