From Machine Translation to Code-Switching: Generating High-Quality Code-Switched Text | Ishan Tarunesh | generating code-switched text is a problem of growing interest , especially given the scarcity of corpora containing large volumes of real code-switched text. in this work , we adapt a state-of-the-art neural machine translation model to generate hindi-english code-switched sentences starting from monolingual hindi sentences. we outline a carefully designed curriculum of pretraining steps , including the use of synthetic code-switched text , that enable the model to generate high-quality code-switched text. using text generated from our model as data augmentation , we show significant reductions in perplexity on a language modeling task , compared to using text from other generative models of cs text. we also show improvements using our text for a downstream code-switched natural language inference task. our generated text is further subjected to a rigorous evaluation using a human evaluation study and a range of objective metrics , where we show performance comparable \( and sometimes even superior \) to code-switched text obtained via crowd workers who are native hindi speakers.
