Investigating label suggestions for opinion mining in German Covid-19 social media | Tilman Beck | this work investigates the use of interactively updated label suggestions to improve upon the efficiency of gathering annotations on the task of opinion mining in german covid-19 social media data. we develop guidelines to conduct a controlled annotation study with social science students and find that suggestions from a model trained on a small , expert-annotated dataset already lead to a substantial improvement – in terms of inter-annotator agreement \( +.14 fleiss’ κ \) and annotation quality – compared to students that do not receive any label suggestions. we further find that label suggestions from interactively trained models do not lead to an improvement over suggestions from a static model. nonetheless , our analysis of suggestion bias shows that annotators remain capable of reflecting upon the suggested label in general. finally , we confirm the quality of the annotated data in transfer learning experiments between different annotator groups. to facilitate further research in opinion mining on social media data , we release our collected data consisting of 200 expert and 2 , 785 student annotations.
