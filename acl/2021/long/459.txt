Controversy and Conformity: from Generalized to Personalized Aggressiveness Detection | Kamil Kanclerz | there is content such as hate speech , offensive , toxic or aggressive documents , which are perceived differently by their consumers. they are commonly identified using classifiers solely based on textual content that generalize pre-agreed meanings of difficult problems. such models provide the same results for each user , which leads to high misclassification rate observable especially for contentious , aggressive documents. both document controversy and user nonconformity require new solutions. therefore , we propose novel personalized approaches that respect individual beliefs expressed by either user conformity-based measures or various embeddings of their previous text annotations. we found that only a few annotations of most controversial documents are enough for all our personalization methods to significantly outperform classic , generalized solutions. the more controversial the content , the greater the gain. the personalized solutions may be used to efficiently filter unwanted aggressive content in the way adjusted to a given person.
