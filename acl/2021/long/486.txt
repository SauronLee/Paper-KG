Learning from Miscellaneous Other-Class Words for Few-shot Named Entity Recognition | Meihan Tong | few-shot named entity recognition \( ner \) exploits only a handful of annotations to iden- tify and classify named entity mentions. pro- totypical network shows superior performance on few-shot ner. however , existing prototyp- ical methods fail to differentiate rich seman- tics in other-class words , which will aggravate overfitting under few shot scenario. to address the issue , we propose a novel model , mining undefined classes from other-class \( muco \) , that can automatically induce different unde- fined classes from the other class to improve few-shot ner. with these extra-labeled unde- fined classes , our method will improve the dis- criminative ability of ner classifier and en- hance the understanding of predefined classes with stand-by semantic knowledge. experi- mental results demonstrate that our model out- performs five state-of-the-art models in both 1- shot and 5-shots settings on four ner bench- marks. we will release the code upon accep- tance. the source code is released on https: //github.com/shuaiwa16/otherclassner.git.
