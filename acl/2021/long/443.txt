Modeling Bilingual Conversational Characteristics for Neural Chat Translation | Yunlong Liang | neural chat translation aims to translate bilingual conversational text , which has a broad application in international exchanges and cooperation. despite the impressive performance of sentence-level and context-aware neural machine translation \( nmt \) , there still remain challenges to translate bilingual conversational text due to its inherent characteristics such as role preference , dialogue coherence , and translation consistency. in this paper , we aim to promote the translation quality of conversational text by modeling the above properties. specifically , we design three latent variational modules to learn the distributions of bilingual conversational characteristics. through sampling from these learned distributions , the latent variables , tailored for role preference , dialogue coherence , and translation consistency , are incorporated into the nmt model for better translation. we evaluate our approach on the benchmark dataset bcontrast \( english<->german \) and a self-collected bilingual dialogue corpus , named bmeld \( english<->chinese \) . extensive experiments show that our approach notably boosts the performance over strong baselines by a large margin and significantly surpasses some state-of-the-art context-aware nmt models in terms of bleu and ter. additionally , we make the bmeld dataset publicly available for the research community.
