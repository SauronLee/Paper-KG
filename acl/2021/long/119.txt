Leveraging Type Descriptions for Zero-shot Named Entity Recognition and Classification | Rami Aly | a common issue in real-world applications of named entity recognition and classification \( nerc \) is the absence of annotated data for the target entity classes during training. zero-shot learning approaches address this issue by learning models from classes with training data that can predict classes without it. this paper presents the first approach for zero-shot nerc , introducing novel architectures that leverage the fact that textual descriptions for many entity classes occur naturally. we address the zero-shot nerc specific challenge that the not-an-entity class is not well defined as different entity classes are considered in training and testing. for evaluation , we adapt two datasets , ontonotes and medmentions , emulating the difficulty of real-world zero-shot learning by testing models on the rarest entity classes. our proposed approach outperforms baselines adapted from machine reading comprehension and zero-shot text classification. furthermore , we assess the effect of different class descriptions for this task.
