InfoSurgeon: Cross-Media Fine-grained Information Consistency Checking for Fake News Detection | Yi Fung | to defend against machine-generated fake news , an effective mechanism is urgently needed. we contribute a novel benchmark for fake news detection at the knowledge element level , as well as a solution for this task which incorporates cross-media consistency checking to detect the fine-grained knowledge elements making news articles misinformative. due to training data scarcity , we also formulate a novel data synthesis method by manipulating knowledge elements within the knowledge graph to generate noisy training data with specific , hard to detect , known inconsistencies. our detection approach outperforms the state-of-the-art \( up to 16.8% accuracy gain \) , and more critically , yields fine-grained explanations.
