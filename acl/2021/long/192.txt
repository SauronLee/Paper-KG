Comprehensive Study: How the Context Information of Different Granularity Affects Dialogue State Tracking? | Puhai Yang | dialogue state tracking \( dst \) plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems to monitor the userâ€™s goal. in general , there are two strategies to track a dialogue state: predicting it from scratch and updating it from previous state. the scratch-based strategy obtains each slot value by inquiring all the dialogue history , and the previous-based strategy relies on the current turn dialogue to update the previous dialogue state. however , it is hard for the scratch-based strategy to correctly track short-dependency dialogue state because of noise; meanwhile , the previous-based strategy is not very useful for long-dependency dialogue state tracking. obviously , it plays different roles for the context information of different granularity to track different kinds of dialogue states. thus , in this paper , we will study and discuss how the context information of different granularity affects dialogue state tracking. first , we explore how greatly different granularities affect dialogue state tracking. then , we further discuss how to combine multiple granularities for dialogue state tracking. finally , we apply the findings about context granularity to few-shot learning scenario. besides , we have publicly released all codes.
