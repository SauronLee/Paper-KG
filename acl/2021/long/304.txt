Adversarial Learning for Discourse Rhetorical Structure Parsing | Longyin Zhang | text-level discourse rhetorical structure \( drs \) parsing is known to be challenging due to the notorious lack of training data. although recent top-down drs parsers can better leverage global document context and have achieved certain success , the performance is still far from perfect. to our knowledge , all previous drs parsers make local decisions for either bottom-up node composition or top-down split point ranking at each time step , and largely ignore drs parsing from the global view point. obviously , it is not sufficient to build an entire drs tree only through these local decisions. in this work , we present our insight on evaluating the pros and cons of the entire drs tree for global optimization. specifically , based on recent well-performing top-down frameworks , we introduce a novel method to transform both gold standard and predicted constituency trees into tree diagrams with two color channels. after that , we learn an adversarial bot between gold and fake tree diagrams to estimate the generated drs trees from a global perspective. we perform experiments on both rst-dt and cdtb corpora and use the original parseval for performance evaluation. the experimental results show that our parser can substantially improve the performance when compared with previous state-of-the-art parsers.
