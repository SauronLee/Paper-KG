Multi-TimeLine Summarization (MTLS): Improving Timeline Summarization by Generating Multiple Summaries | Yi Yu | in this paper , we address a novel task , multiple timeline summarization \( mtls \) , which extends the flexibility and versatility of time-line summarization \( tls \) . given any collection of time-stamped news articles , mtls automatically discovers important yet different stories and generates a corresponding time-line for each story.to achieve this , we propose a novel unsupervised summarization framework based on two-stage affinity propagation. we also introduce a quantitative evaluation measure for mtls based on previoustls evaluation methods. experimental results show that our mtls framework demonstrates high effectiveness and mtls task can give bet-ter results than tls.
