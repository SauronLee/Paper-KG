Concept-Based Label Embedding via Dynamic Routing for Hierarchical Text Classification | Xuepeng Wang | hierarchical text classification \( htc \) is a challenging task that categorizes a textual description within a taxonomic hierarchy. most of the existing methods focus on modeling the text. recently , researchers attempt to model the class representations with some resources \( e.g. , external dictionaries \) . however , the concept shared among classes which is a kind of domain-specific and fine-grained information has been ignored in previous work. in this paper , we propose a novel concept-based label embedding method that can explicitly represent the concept and model the sharing mechanism among classes for the hierarchical text classification. experimental results on two widely used datasets prove that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. we release our complementary resources \( concepts and definitions of classes \) for these two datasets to benefit the research on htc.
