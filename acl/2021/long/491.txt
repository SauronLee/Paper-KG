Document-level Event Extraction via Parallel Prediction Networks | Hang Yang | document-level event extraction \( dee \) is indispensable when events are described throughout a document. we argue that sentence-level extractors are ill-suited to the dee task where event arguments always scatter across sentences and multiple events may co-exist in a document. it is a challenging task because it requires a holistic understanding of the document and an aggregated ability to assemble arguments across multiple sentences. in this paper , we propose an end-to-end model , which can extract structured events from a document in a parallel manner. specifically , we first introduce a document-level encoder to obtain the document-aware representations. then , a multi-granularity non-autoregressive decoder is used to generate events in parallel. finally , to train the entire model , a matching loss function is proposed , which can bootstrap a global optimization. the empirical results on the widely used dee dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the challenging dee task. code will be available at https://github.com/hangyang-nlp/de-ppn.
