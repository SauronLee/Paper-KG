DialogueCRN: Contextual Reasoning Networks for Emotion Recognition in Conversations | Dou Hu | emotion recognition in conversations \( erc \) has gained increasing attention for developing empathetic machines. recently , many approaches have been devoted to perceiving conversational context by deep learning models. however , these approaches are insufficient in understanding the context due to lacking the ability to extract and integrate emotional clues. in this work , we propose novel contextual reasoning networks \( dialoguecrn \) to fully understand the conversational context from a cognitive perspective. inspired by the cognitive theory of emotion , we design multi-turn reasoning modules to extract and integrate emotional clues. the reasoning module iteratively performs an intuitive retrieving process and a conscious reasoning process , which imitates human unique cognitive thinking. extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.
