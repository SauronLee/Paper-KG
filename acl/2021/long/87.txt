Explainable Prediction of Text Complexity: The Missing Preliminaries for Text Simplification | Cristina Garbacea | text simplification reduces the language complexity of professional content for accessibility purposes. end-to-end neural network models have been widely adopted to directly generate the simplified version of input text , usually functioning as a blackbox. we show that text simplification can be decomposed into a compact pipeline of tasks to ensure the transparency and explainability of the process. the first two steps in this pipeline are often neglected: 1 \) to predict whether a given piece of text needs to be simplified , and 2 \) if yes , to identify complex parts of the text. the two tasks can be solved separately using either lexical or deep learning methods , or solved jointly. simply applying explainable complexity prediction as a preliminary step , the out-of-sample text simplification performance of the state-of-the-art , black-box simplification models can be improved by a large margin.
