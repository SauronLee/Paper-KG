Generating Relevant and Coherent Dialogue Responses using Self-Separated Conditional Variational AutoEncoders | Bin Sun | conditional variational autoencoder \( cvae \) effectively increases the diversity and informativeness of responses in open-ended dialogue generation tasks through enriching the context vector with sampled latent variables. however , due to the inherent one-to-many and many-to-one phenomena in human dialogues , the sampled latent variables may not correctly reflect the contexts’ semantics , leading to irrelevant and incoherent generated responses. to resolve this problem , we propose self-separated conditional variational autoencoder \( abbreviated as sepacvae \) that introduces group information to regularize the latent variables , which enhances cvae by improving the responses’ relevance and coherence while maintaining their diversity and informativeness. sepacvae actively divides the input data into groups , and then widens the absolute difference between data pairs from distinct groups , while narrowing the relative distance between data pairs in the same group. empirical results from automatic evaluation and detailed analysis demonstrate that sepacvae can significantly boost responses in well-established open-domain dialogue datasets.
