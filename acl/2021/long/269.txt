Novel Slot Detection: A Benchmark for Discovering Unknown Slot Types in the Task-Oriented Dialogue System | Yanan Wu | existing slot filling models can only recognize pre-defined in-domain slot types from a limited slot set. in the practical application , a reliable dialogue system should know what it does not know. in this paper , we introduce a new task , novel slot detection \( nsd \) , in the task-oriented dialogue system. nsd aims to discover unknown or out-of-domain slot types to strengthen the capability of a dialogue system based on in-domain training data. besides , we construct two public nsd datasets , propose several strong nsd baselines , and establish a benchmark for future work. finally , we conduct exhaustive experiments and qualitative analysis to comprehend key challenges and provide new guidance for future directions.
