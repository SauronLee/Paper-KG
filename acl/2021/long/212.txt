Factoring Statutory Reasoning as Language Understanding Challenges | Nils Holzenberger | statutory reasoning is the task of determining whether a legal statute , stated in natural language , applies to the text description of a case. prior work introduced a resource that approached statutory reasoning as a monolithic textual entailment problem , with neural baselines performing nearly at-chance. to address this challenge , we decompose statutory reasoning into four types of language-understanding challenge problems , through the introduction of concepts and structure found in prolog programs. augmenting an existing benchmark , we provide annotations for the four tasks , and baselines for three of them. models for statutory reasoning are shown to benefit from the additional structure , improving on prior baselines. further , the decomposition into subtasks facilitates finer-grained model diagnostics and clearer incremental progress.
