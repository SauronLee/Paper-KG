A Dataset and Baselines for Multilingual Reply Suggestion | Mozhi Zhang | reply suggestion models help users process emails and chats faster. previous work only studies english reply suggestion. instead , we present mrs , a multilingual reply suggestion dataset with ten languages. mrs can be used to compare two families of models: 1 \) retrieval models that select the reply from a fixed set and 2 \) generation models that produce the reply from scratch. therefore , mrs complements existing cross-lingual generalization benchmarks that focus on classification and sequence labeling tasks. we build a generation model and a retrieval model as baselines for mrs. the two models have different strengths in the monolingual setting , and they require different strategies to generalize across languages. mrs is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangmozhi/mrs.
