Element Intervention for Open Relation Extraction | Fangchao Liu | open relation extraction aims to cluster relation instances referring to the same underlying relation , which is a critical step for general relation extraction. current openre models are commonly trained on the datasets generated from distant supervision , which often results in instability and makes the model easily collapsed. in this paper , we revisit the procedure of openre from a causal view. by formulating openre using a structural causal model , we identify that the above-mentioned problems stem from the spurious correlations from entities and context to the relation type. to address this issue , we conduct
