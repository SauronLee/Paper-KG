Automatic ICD Coding via Interactive Shared Representation Networks with Self-distillation Mechanism | Tong Zhou | the icd coding task aims at assigning codes of the international classification of diseases in clinical notes. since manual coding is very laborious and prone to errors , many methods have been proposed for the automatic icd coding task. however , existing works either ignore the long-tail of code frequency or the noisy clinical notes. to address the above issues , we propose an interactive shared representation network with self-distillation mechanism. specifically , an interactive shared representation network targets building connections among codes while modeling the co-occurrence , consequently alleviating the long-tail problem. moreover , to cope with the noisy text issue , we encourage the model to focus on the clinical noteâ€™s noteworthy part and extract valuable information through a self-distillation learning mechanism. experimental results on two mimic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
