Integrating Semantics and Neighborhood Information with Graph-Driven Generative Models for Document Retrieval | Zijing Ou | with the need of fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint , document hashing has been playing a crucial role in large-scale information retrieval. to generate high-quality hashing code , both semantics and neighborhood information are crucial. however , most existing methods leverage only one of them or simply combine them via some intuitive criteria , lacking a theoretical principle to guide the integration process. in this paper , we encode the neighborhood information with a graph-induced gaussian distribution , and propose to integrate the two types of information with a graph-driven generative model. to deal with the complicated correlations among documents , we further propose a tree-structured approximation method for learning. under the approximation , we prove that the training objective can be decomposed into terms involving only singleton or pairwise documents , enabling the model to be trained as efficiently as uncorrelated ones. extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods , demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model for simultaneously preserving semantic and neighborhood information.
