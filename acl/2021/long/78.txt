Prosodic segmentation for parsing spoken dialogue | Elizabeth Nielsen | parsing spoken dialogue poses unique difficulties , including disfluencies and unmarked boundaries between sentence-like units. previous work has shown that prosody can help with parsing disfluent speech \( tran et al. 2018 \) , but has assumed that the input to the parser is already segmented into sentence-like units \( sus \) , which isn’t true in existing speech applications. we investigate how prosody affects a parser that receives an entire dialogue turn as input \( a turn-based model \) , instead of gold standard pre-segmented sus \( an su-based model \) . in experiments on the english switchboard corpus , we find that when using transcripts alone , the turn-based model has trouble segmenting sus , leading to worse parse performance than the su-based model. however , prosody can effectively replace gold standard su boundaries: with prosody , the turn-based model performs as well as the su-based model \( 91.38 vs. 91.06 f1 score , respectively \) , despite performing two tasks \( su segmentation and parsing \) rather than one \( parsing alone \) . analysis shows that pitch and intensity features are the most important for this corpus , since they allow the model to correctly distinguish an su boundary from a speech disfluency – a distinction that the model otherwise struggles to make.
