Multimodal Multi-Speaker Merger & Acquisition Financial Modeling: A New Task, Dataset, and Neural Baselines | Ramit Sawhney | risk prediction is an essential task in financial markets. merger and acquisition \( m&a \) calls provide key insights into the claims made by company executives about the restructuring of the financial firms. extracting vocal and textual cues from m&a calls can help model the risk associated with such financial activities. to aid the analysis of m&a calls , we curate a dataset of conference call transcripts and their corresponding audio recordings for the time period ranging from 2016 to 2020. we introduce m3anet , a baseline architecture that takes advantage of the multimodal multi-speaker input to forecast the financial risk associated with the m&a calls. empirical results prove that the task is challenging , with the pro-posed architecture performing marginally better than strong bert-based baselines. we release the m3a dataset and benchmark models to motivate future research on this challenging problem domain.
