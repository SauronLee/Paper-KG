RAW-C: Relatedness of Ambiguous Words in Context (A New Lexical Resource for English) | Sean Trott | most words are ambiguous—-i.e. , they convey distinct meanings in different contexts—-and even the meanings of unambiguous words are context-dependent. both phenomena present a challenge for nlp. recently , the advent of contextualized word embeddings has led to success on tasks involving lexical ambiguity , such as word sense disambiguation. however , there are few tasks that directly evaluate how well these contextualized embeddings accommodate the more continuous , dynamic nature of word meaning—-particularly in a way that matches human intuitions. we introduce raw-c , a dataset of graded , human relatedness judgments for 112 ambiguous words in context \( with 672 sentence pairs total \) , as well as human estimates of sense dominance. the average inter-annotator agreement \( assessed using a leave-one-annotator-out method \) was 0.79. we then show that a measure of cosine distance , computed using contextualized embeddings from bert and elmo , correlates with human judgments , but that cosine distance also systematically underestimates how similar humans find uses of the same sense of a word to be , and systematically overestimates how similar humans find uses of different-sense homonyms. finally , we propose a synthesis between psycholinguistic theories of the mental lexicon and computational models of lexical semantics.
