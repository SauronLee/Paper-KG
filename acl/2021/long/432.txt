Exploring Distantly-Labeled Rationales in Neural Network Models | Quzhe Huang | recent studies strive to incorporate various human rationales into neural networks to improve model performance , but few pay attention to the quality of the rationales. most existing methods distribute their modelsâ€™ focus to distantly-labeled rationale words entirely and equally , while ignoring the potential important non-rationale words and not distinguishing the importance of different rationale words. in this paper , we propose two novel auxiliary loss functions to make better use of distantly-labeled rationales , which encourage models to maintain their focus on important words beyond labeled rationales \( pins \) and alleviate redundant training on non-helpful rationales \( noirs \) . experiments on two representative classification tasks show that our proposed methods can push a classification model to effectively learn crucial clues from non-perfect rationales while maintaining the ability to spread its focus to other unlabeled important words , thus significantly outperform existing methods.
