PROTAUGMENT: Unsupervised diverse short-texts paraphrasing for intent detection meta-learning | Thomas Dopierre | recent research considers few-shot intent detection as a meta-learning problem: the model is learning to learn from a consecutive set of small tasks named episodes. in this work , we propose protaugment , a meta-learning algorithm for short texts classification \( the intent detection task \) . protaugment is a novel extension of prototypical networks , that limits overfitting on the bias introduced by the few-shots classification objective at each episode. it relies on diverse paraphrasing: a conditional language model is first fine-tuned for paraphrasing , and diversity is later introduced at the decoding stage at each meta-learning episode. the diverse paraphrasing is unsupervised as it is applied to unlabelled data , and then fueled to the prototypical network training objective as a consistency loss. protaugment is the state-of-the-art method for intent detection meta-learning , at no extra labeling efforts and without the need to fine-tune a conditional language model on a given application domain.
