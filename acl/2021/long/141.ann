T5	Issues 170 312	document-level contexts can significantly improve model performance. in many application scenarios , however , such contexts are not available
R3	Challenges Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3	
T6	Methods 330 512	we propose to find external contexts of a sentence by retrieving and selecting a set of semantically relevant texts through a search engine , with the original sentence as the query.
T7	Definitions 513 803	we find empirically that the contextual representations computed on the retrieval-based input view , constructed through the concatenation of a sentence and its external contexts , can achieve significantly improved performance compared to the original input view based only on the sentence
