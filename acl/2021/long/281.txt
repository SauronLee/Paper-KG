Measuring Fine-Grained Domain Relevance of Terms: A Hierarchical Core-Fringe Approach | Jie Huang | we propose to measure fine-grained domain relevanceâ€“ the degree that a term is relevant to a broad \( e.g. , computer science \) or narrow \( e.g. , deep learning \) domain. such measurement is crucial for many downstream tasks in natural language processing. to handle long-tail terms , we build a core-anchored semantic graph , which uses core terms with rich description information to bridge the vast remaining fringe terms semantically. to support a fine-grained domain without relying on a matching corpus for supervision , we develop hierarchical core-fringe learning , which learns core and fringe terms jointly in a semi-supervised manner contextualized in the hierarchy of the domain. to reduce expensive human efforts , we employ automatic annotation and hierarchical positive-unlabeled learning. our approach applies to big or small domains , covers head or tail terms , and requires little human effort. extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines and even surpass professional human performance.
