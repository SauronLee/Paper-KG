Causal Analysis of Syntactic Agreement Mechanisms in Neural Language Models | Matthew Finlayson | targeted syntactic evaluations have demonstrated the ability of language models to perform subject-verb agreement given difficult contexts. to elucidate the mechanisms by which the models accomplish this behavior , this study applies causal mediation analysis to pre-trained neural language models. we investigate the magnitude of models’ preferences for grammatical inflections , as well as whether neurons process subject-verb agreement similarly across sentences with different syntactic structures. we uncover similarities and differences across architectures and model sizes—notably , that larger models do not necessarily learn stronger preferences. we also observe two distinct mechanisms for producing subject-verb agreement depending on the syntactic structure of the input sentence. finally , we find that language models rely on similar sets of neurons when given sentences with similar syntactic structure.
