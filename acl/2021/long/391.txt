Improving Document Representations by Generating Pseudo Query Embeddings for Dense Retrieval | Hongyin Tang | recently , the retrieval models based on dense representations have been gradually applied in the first stage of the document retrieval tasks , showing better performance than traditional sparse vector space models. to obtain high efficiency , the basic structure of these models is bi-encoder in most cases. however , this simple structure may cause serious information loss during the encoding of documents since the queries are agnostic. to address this problem , we design a method to mimic the queries to each of the documents by an iterative clustering process and represent the documents by multiple pseudo queries \( i.e. , the cluster centroids \) . to boost the retrieval process using approximate nearest neighbor search library , we also optimize the matching function with a two-step score calculation procedure. experimental results on several popular ranking and qa datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art results while still remaining high efficiency.
