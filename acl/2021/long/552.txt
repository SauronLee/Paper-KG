ADEPT: An Adjective-Dependent Plausibility Task | Ali Emami | a false contract is more likely to be rejected than a contract is , yet a false key is less likely than a key to open doors. while correctly interpreting and assessing the effects of such adjective-noun pairs \( e.g. , false key \) on the plausibility of given events \( e.g. , opening doors \) underpins many natural language understanding tasks , doing so often requires a significant degree of world knowledge and common-sense reasoning. we introduce adept â€“ a large-scale semantic plausibility task consisting of over 16 thousand sentences that are paired with slightly modified versions obtained by adding an adjective to a noun. overall , we find that while the task appears easier for human judges \( 85% accuracy \) , it proves more difficult for transformer-based models like roberta \( 71% accuracy \) . our experiments also show that neither the adjective itself nor its taxonomic class suffice in determining the correct plausibility judgement , emphasizing the importance of endowing automatic natural language understanding systems with more context sensitivity and common-sense reasoning.
