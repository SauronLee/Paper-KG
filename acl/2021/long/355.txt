TWAG: A Topic-Guided Wikipedia Abstract Generator | Fangwei Zhu | wikipedia abstract generation aims to distill a wikipedia abstract from web sources and has met significant success by adopting multi-document summarization techniques. however , previous works generally view the abstract as plain text , ignoring the fact that it is a description of a certain entity and can be decomposed into different topics. in this paper , we propose a two-stage model twag that guides the abstract generation with topical information. first , we detect the topic of each input paragraph with a classifier trained on existing wikipedia articles to divide input documents into different topics. then , we predict the topic distribution of each abstract sentence , and decode the sentence from topic-aware representations with a pointer-generator network. we evaluate our model on the wikicatsum dataset , and the results show that twag outperforms various existing baselines and is capable of generating comprehensive abstracts.
