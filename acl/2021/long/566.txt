Neural Machine Translation with Monolingual Translation Memory | Deng Cai | prior work has proved that translation memory \( tm \) can boost the performance of neural machine translation \( nmt \) . in contrast to existing work that uses bilingual corpus as tm and employs source-side similarity search for memory retrieval , we propose a new framework that uses monolingual memory and performs learnable memory retrieval in a cross-lingual manner. our framework has unique advantages. first , the cross-lingual memory retriever allows abundant monolingual data to be tm. second , the memory retriever and nmt model can be jointly optimized for the ultimate translation goal. experiments show that the proposed method obtains substantial improvements. remarkably , it even outperforms strong tm-augmented nmt baselines using bilingual tm. owning to the ability to leverage monolingual data , our model also demonstrates effectiveness in low-resource and domain adaptation scenarios.
