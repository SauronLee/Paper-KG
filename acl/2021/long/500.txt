DYPLOC: Dynamic Planning of Content Using Mixed Language Models for Text Generation | Xinyu Hua | we study the task of long-form opinion text generation , which faces at least two distinct challenges. first , existing neural generation models fall short of coherence , thus requiring efficient content planning. second , diverse types of information are needed to guide the generator to cover both subjective and objective content. to this end , we propose dyploc , a generation framework that conducts dynamic planning of content while generating the output based on a novel design of mixed language models. to enrich the generation with diverse content , we further propose to use large pre-trained models to predict relevant concepts and to generate claims. we experiment with two challenging tasks on newly collected datasets: \( 1 \) argument generation with reddit changemyview , and \( 2 \) writing articles using new york timesâ€™ opinion section. automatic evaluation shows that our model significantly outperforms competitive comparisons. human judges further confirm that our generations are more coherent with richer content.
