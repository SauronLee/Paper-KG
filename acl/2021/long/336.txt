Hierarchy-aware Label Semantics Matching Network for Hierarchical Text Classification | Haibin Chen | hierarchical text classification is an important yet challenging task due to the complex structure of the label hierarchy. existing methods ignore the semantic relationship between text and labels , so they cannot make full use of the hierarchical information. to this end , we formulate the text-label semantics relationship as a semantic matching problem and thus propose a hierarchy-aware label semantics matching network \( himatch \) . first , we project text semantics and label semantics into a joint embedding space. we then introduce a joint embedding loss and a matching learning loss to model the matching relationship between the text semantics and the label semantics. our model captures the text-label semantics matching relationship among coarse-grained labels and fine-grained labels in a hierarchy-aware manner. the experimental results on various benchmark datasets verify that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.
