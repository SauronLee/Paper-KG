R3	Challenges Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4	
T6	Methods 324 395	applies causal mediation analysis to pre-trained neural language models
R4	Solution Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5	
T7	Theories 601 752	we uncover similarities and differences across architectures and model sizesâ€”notably , that larger models do not necessarily learn stronger preferences
T8	Theories 754 1016	we also observe two distinct mechanisms for producing subject-verb agreement depending on the syntactic structure of the input sentence. finally , we find that language models rely on similar sets of neurons when given sentences with similar syntactic structure.
