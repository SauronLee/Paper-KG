Learning Latent Structures for Cross Action Phrase Relations in Wet Lab Protocols | Chaitanya Kulkarni | wet laboratory protocols \( wlps \) are critical for conveying reproducible procedures in biological research. they are composed of instructions written in natural language describing the step-wise processing of materials by specific actions. this process flow description for reagents and materials synthesis in wlps can be captured by material state transfer graphs \( mstgs \) , which encode global temporal and causal relationships between actions. here , we propose methods to automatically generate a mstg for a given protocol by extracting all action relationships across multiple sentences. we also note that previous corpora and methods focused primarily on local intra-sentence relationships between actions and entities and did not address two critical issues: \( i \) resolution of implicit arguments and \( ii \) establishing long-range dependencies across sentences. we propose a new model that incrementally learns latent structures and is better suited to resolving inter-sentence relations and implicit arguments. this model draws upon a new corpus wlp-mstg which was created by extending annotations in the wlp corpora for inter-sentence relations and implicit arguments. our model achieves an f1 score of 54.53% for temporal and causal relations in protocols from our corpus , which is a significant improvement over previous models - dygie++:28.17%; spert:27.81%. we make our annotated wlp-mstg corpus available to the research community.
