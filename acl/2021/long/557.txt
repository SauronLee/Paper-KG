SpanNER: Named Entity Re-/Recognition as Span Prediction | Jinlan Fu | recent years have seen the paradigm shift of named entity recognition \( ner \) systems from sequence labeling to span prediction. despite its preliminary effectiveness , the span prediction model’s architectural bias has not been fully understood. in this paper , we first investigate the strengths and weaknesses when the span prediction model is used for named entity recognition compared with the sequence labeling framework and how to further improve it , which motivates us to make complementary advantages of systems based on different paradigms. we then reveal that span prediction , simultaneously , can serve as a system combiner to re-recognize named entities from different systems’ outputs. we experimentally implement 154 systems on 11 datasets , covering three languages , comprehensive results show the effectiveness of span prediction models that both serve as base ner systems and system combiners. we make all codes and datasets available:
