Defense against Synonym Substitution-based Adversarial Attacks via Dirichlet Neighborhood Ensemble | Yi Zhou | although deep neural networks have achieved prominent performance on many nlp tasks , they are vulnerable to adversarial examples. we propose dirichlet neighborhood ensemble \( dne \) , a randomized method for training a robust model to defense synonym substitution-based attacks. during training , dne forms virtual sentences by sampling embedding vectors for each word in an input sentence from a convex hull spanned by the word and its synonyms , and it augments them with the training data. in such a way , the model is robust to adversarial attacks while maintaining the performance on the original clean data. dne is agnostic to the network architectures and scales to large models \( e.g. , bert \) for nlp applications. through extensive experimentation , we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recently proposed defense methods by a significant margin across different network architectures and multiple data sets.
