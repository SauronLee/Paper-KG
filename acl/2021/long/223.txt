Cascade versus Direct Speech Translation: Do the Differences Still Make a Difference? | Luisa Bentivogli | five years after the first published proofs of concept , direct approaches to speech translation \( st \) are now competing with traditional cascade solutions. in light of this steady progress , can we claim that the performance gap between the two is closed \? starting from this question , we present a systematic comparison between state-of-the-art systems representative of the two paradigms. focusing on three language directions \( english-german/italian/spanish \) , we conduct automatic and manual evaluations , exploiting high-quality professional post-edits and annotations. our multi-faceted analysis on one of the few publicly available st benchmarks attests for the first time that: i \) the gap between the two paradigms is now closed , and ii \) the subtle differences observed in their behavior are not sufficient for humans neither to distinguish them nor to prefer one over the other.
