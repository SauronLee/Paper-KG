Transferable Dialogue Systems and User Simulators | Bo-Hsiang Tseng | one of the difficulties in training dialogue systems is the lack of training data. we explore the possibility of creating dialogue data through the interaction between a dialogue system and a user simulator. our goal is to develop a modelling framework that can incorporate new dialogue scenarios through self-play between the two agents. in this framework , we first pre-train the two agents on a collection of source domain dialogues , which equips the agents to converse with each other via natural language. with further fine-tuning on a small amount of target domain data , the agents continue to interact with the aim of improving their behaviors using reinforcement learning with structured reward functions. in experiments on the multiwoz dataset , two practical transfer learning problems are investigated: 1 \) domain adaptation and 2 \) single-to-multiple domain transfer. we demonstrate that the proposed framework is highly effective in bootstrapping the performance of the two agents in transfer learning. we also show that our method leads to improvements in dialogue system performance on complete datasets.
