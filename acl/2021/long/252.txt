Answering Ambiguous Questions through Generative Evidence Fusion and Round-Trip Prediction | Yifan Gao | in open-domain question answering , questions are highly likely to be ambiguous because users may not know the scope of relevant topics when formulating them. therefore , a system needs to find possible interpretations of the question , and predict one or multiple plausible answers. when multiple plausible answers are found , the system should rewrite the question for each answer to resolve the ambiguity. in this paper , we present a model that aggregates and combines evidence from multiple passages to adaptively predict a single answer or a set of question-answer pairs for ambiguous questions. in addition , we propose a novel round-trip prediction approach to iteratively generate additional interpretations that our model fails to find in the first pass , and then verify and filter out the incorrect question-answer pairs to arrive at the final disambiguated output. our model , named refuel , achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the ambigqa dataset , and shows competitive performance on nq-open and triviaqa. the proposed round-trip prediction is a model-agnostic general approach for answering ambiguous open-domain questions , which improves our refuel as well as several baseline models. we release source code for our models and experiments at https://github.com/amzn/refuel-open-domain-qa.
