Verb Metaphor Detection via Contextual Relation Learning | Wei Song | correct natural language understanding requires computers to distinguish the literal and metaphorical senses of a word. recent neu- ral models achieve progress on verb metaphor detection by viewing it as sequence labeling. in this paper , we argue that it is appropriate to view this task as relation classification between a verb and its various contexts. we propose the metaphor-relation bert \( mr-bert \) model , which explicitly models the relation between a verb and its grammatical , sentential and semantic contexts. we evaluate our method on the vua , moh-x and trofi datasets. our method gets competitive results compared with state-of-the-art approaches.
