Psycholinguistic Tripartite Graph Network for Personality Detection | Tao Yang | most of the recent work on personality detection from online posts adopts multifarious deep neural networks to represent the posts and builds predictive models in a data-driven manner , without the exploitation of psycholinguistic knowledge that may unveil the connections between oneâ€™s language use and his psychological traits. in this paper , we propose a psycholinguistic knowledge-based tripartite graph network , trignet , which consists of a tripartite graph network and a bert-based graph initializer. the graph network injects structural psycholinguistic knowledge in liwc , a computerized instrument for psycholinguistic analysis , by constructing a heterogeneous tripartite graph. the initializer is employed to provide initial embeddings for the graph nodes. to reduce the computational cost in graph learning , we further propose a novel flow graph attention network \( gat \) that only transmits messages between neighboring parties in the tripartite graph. benefiting from the tripartite graph , trignet can aggregate post information from a psychological perspective , which is a novel way of exploiting domain knowledge. extensive experiments on two datasets show that trignet outperforms the existing state-of-art model by 3.47 and 2.10 points in average f1. moreover , the flow gat reduces the flops and memory measures by 38% and 32% , respectively , in comparison to the original gat in our setting.
