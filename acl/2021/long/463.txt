PHMOSpell: Phonological and Morphological Knowledge Guided Chinese Spelling Check | Li Huang | chinese spelling check \( csc \) is a challenging task due to the complex characteristics of chinese characters. statistics reveal that most chinese spelling errors belong to phonological or visual errors. however , previous methods rarely utilize phonological and morphological knowledge of chinese characters or heavily rely on external resources to model their similarities. to address the above issues , we propose a novel end-to-end trainable model called phmospell , which promotes the performance of csc with multi-modal information. specifically , we derive pinyin and glyph representations for chinese characters from audio and visual modalities respectively , which are integrated into a pre-trained language model by a well-designed adaptive gating mechanism. to verify its effectiveness , we conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation tests. experimental results on three shared benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.
