Attend What You Need: Motion-Appearance Synergistic Networks for Video Question Answering | Ahjeong Seo | video question answering is a task which requires an ai agent to answer questions grounded in video. this task entails three key challenges: \( 1 \) understand the intention of various questions , \( 2 \) capturing various elements of the input video \( e.g. , object , action , causality \) , and \( 3 \) cross-modal grounding between language and vision information. we propose motion-appearance synergistic networks \( masn \) , which embed two cross-modal features grounded on motion and appearance information and selectively utilize them depending on the questionâ€™s intentions. masn consists of a motion module , an appearance module , and a motion-appearance fusion module. the motion module computes the action-oriented cross-modal joint representations , while the appearance module focuses on the appearance aspect of the input video. finally , the motion-appearance fusion module takes each output of the motion module and the appearance module as input , and performs question-guided fusion. as a result , masn achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the tgif-qa and msvd-qa datasets. we also conduct qualitative analysis by visualizing the inference results of masn.
