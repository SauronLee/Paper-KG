Modeling Transitions of Focal Entities for Conversational Knowledge Base Question Answering | Yunshi Lan | conversational kbqa is about answering a sequence of questions related to a kb. follow-up questions in conversational kbqa often have missing information referring to entities from the conversation history. in this paper , we propose to model these implied entities , which we refer to as the focal entities of the conversation. we propose a novel graph-based model to capture the transitions of focal entities and apply a graph neural network to derive a probability distribution of focal entities for each question , which is then combined with a standard kbqa module to perform answer ranking. our experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
