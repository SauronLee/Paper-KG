ForecastQA: A Question Answering Challenge for Event Forecasting with Temporal Text Data | Woojeong Jin | event forecasting is a challenging , yet important task , as humans seek to constantly plan for the future. existing automated forecasting studies rely mostly on structured data , such as time-series or event-based knowledge graphs , to help predict future events. in this work , we aim to formulate a task , construct a dataset , and provide benchmarks for developing methods for event forecasting with large volumes of unstructured text data. to simulate the forecasting scenario on temporal news documents , we formulate the problem as a restricted-domain , multiple-choice , question-answering \( qa \) task. unlike existing qa tasks , our task limits accessible information , and thus a model has to make a forecasting judgement. to showcase the usefulness of this task formulation , we introduce forecastqa , a question-answering dataset consisting of 10 , 392 event forecasting questions , which have been collected and verified via crowdsourcing efforts. we present our experiments on forecastqa using bertbased models and find that our best model achieves 61.0% accuracy on the dataset , which still lags behind human performance by about 19%. we hope forecastqa will support future research efforts in bridging this gap.
