Cross-language Sentence Selection via Data Augmentation and Rationale Training | Yanda Chen | this paper proposes an approach to cross-language sentence selection in a low-resource setting. it uses data augmentation and negative sampling techniques on noisy parallel sentence data to directly learn a cross-lingual embedding-based query relevance model. results show that this approach performs as well as or better than multiple state-of-the-art machine translation + monolingual retrieval systems trained on the same parallel data. moreover , when a rationale training secondary objective is applied to encourage the model to match word alignment hints from a phrase-based statistical machine translation model , consistent improvements are seen across three language pairs \( english-somali , english-swahili and english-tagalog \) over a variety of state-of-the-art baselines.
