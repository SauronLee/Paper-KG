Breaking Down the Invisible Wall of Informal Fallacies in Online Discussions | Saumya Sahai | people debate on a variety of topics on online platforms such as reddit , or facebook. debates can be lengthy , with users exchanging a wealth of information and opinions. however , conversations do not always go smoothly , and users sometimes engage in unsound argumentation techniques to prove a claim. these techniques are called fallacies. fallacies are persuasive arguments that provide insufficient or incorrect evidence to support the claim. in this paper , we study the most frequent fallacies on reddit , and we present them using the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation. we construct a new annotated dataset of fallacies , using user comments containing fallacy mentions as noisy labels , and cleaning the data via crowdsourcing. finally , we study the task of classifying fallacies using neural models. we find that generally the models perform better in the presence of conversational context.we have released the data and the code at github.com/sahaisaumya/informal_fallacies.
