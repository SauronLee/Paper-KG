Enhancing Content Preservation in Text Style Transfer Using Reverse Attention and Conditional Layer Normalization | Dongkyu Lee | text style transfer aims to alter the style \( e.g. , sentiment \) of a sentence while preserving its content. a common approach is to map a given sentence to content representation that is free of style , and the content representation is fed to a decoder with a target style. previous methods in filtering style completely remove tokens with style at the token level , which incurs the loss of content information. in this paper , we propose to enhance content preservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with reverse attention , and thereby retain the content. furthermore , we fuse content information when building the target style representation , making it dynamic with respect to the content. our method creates not only style-independent content representation , but also content-dependent style representation in transferring style. empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in terms of content preservation. in addition , it is also competitive in terms of style transfer accuracy and fluency.
