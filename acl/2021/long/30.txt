Deep Differential Amplifier for Extractive Summarization | Ruipeng Jia | for sentence-level extractive summarization , there is a disproportionate ratio of selected and unselected sentences , leading to flatting the summary features when maximizing the accuracy. the imbalanced classification of summarization is inherent , which canâ€™t be addressed by common algorithms easily. in this paper , we conceptualize the single-document extractive summarization as a rebalance problem and present a deep differential amplifier framework. specifically , we first calculate and amplify the semantic difference between each sentence and all other sentences , and then apply the residual unit as the second item of the differential amplifier to deepen the architecture. finally , to compensate for the imbalance , the corresponding objective loss of minority class is boosted by a weighted cross-entropy. in contrast to previous approaches , this model pays more attention to the pivotal information of one sentence , instead of all the informative context modeling by recurrent or transformer architecture. we demonstrate experimentally on two benchmark datasets that our summarizer performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. our source code will be available on github.
