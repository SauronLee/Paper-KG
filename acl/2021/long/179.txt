Chase: A Large-Scale and Pragmatic Chinese Dataset for Cross-Database Context-Dependent Text-to-SQL | Jiaqi Guo | the cross-database context-dependent text-to-sql \( xdts \) problem has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its wide range of potential applications. however , we identify two biases in existing datasets for xdts: \( 1 \) a high proportion of context-independent questions and \( 2 \) a high proportion of easy sql queries. these biases conceal the major challenges in xdts to some extent. in this work , we present chase , a large-scale and pragmatic chinese dataset for xdts. it consists of 5 , 459 coherent question sequences \( 17 , 940 questions with their sql queries annotated \) over 280 databases , in which only 35% of questions are context-independent , and 28% of sql queries are easy. we experiment on chase with three state-of-the-art xdts approaches. the best approach only achieves an exact match accuracy of 40% over all questions and 16% over all question sequences , indicating that chase highlights the challenging problems of xdts. we believe that xdts can provide fertile soil for addressing the problems.
