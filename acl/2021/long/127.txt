Topic-Aware Evidence Reasoning and Stance-Aware Aggregation for Fact Verification | Jiasheng Si | fact verification is a challenging task that requires simultaneously reasoning and aggregating over multiple retrieved pieces of evidence to evaluate the truthfulness of a claim. existing approaches typically \( i \) explore the semantic interaction between the claim and evidence at different granularity levels but fail to capture their topical consistency during the reasoning process , which we believe is crucial for verification; \( ii \) aggregate multiple pieces of evidence equally without considering their implicit stances to the claim , thereby introducing spurious information. to alleviate the above issues , we propose a novel topic-aware evidence reasoning and stance-aware aggregation model for more accurate fact verification , with the following four key properties: 1 \) checking topical consistency between the claim and evidence; 2 \) maintaining topical coherence among multiple pieces of evidence; 3 \) ensuring semantic similarity between the global topic information and the semantic representation of evidence; 4 \) aggregating evidence based on their implicit stances to the claim. extensive experiments conducted on the two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over several state-of-the-art approaches for fact verification. the source code can be obtained from https://github.com/jasenchn/tarsa.
