Controllable Open-ended Question Generation with A New Question Type Ontology | Shuyang Cao | we investigate the less-explored task of generating open-ended questions that are typically answered by multiple sentences. we first define a new question type ontology which differentiates the nuanced nature of questions better than widely used question words. a new dataset with 4 , 959 questions is labeled based on the new ontology. we then propose a novel question type-aware question generation framework , augmented by a semantic graph representation , to jointly predict question focuses and produce the question. based on this framework , we further use both exemplars and automatically generated templates to improve controllability and diversity. experiments on two newly collected large-scale datasets show that our model improves question quality over competitive comparisons based on automatic metrics. human judges also rate our model outputs highly in answerability , coverage of scope , and overall quality. finally , our model variants with templates can produce questions with enhanced controllability and diversity.
