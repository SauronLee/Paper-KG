T5	Issues 160 607	kbs store structured knowledge that can support long range reasoning , while text stores more comprehensive and timely knowledge in an unstructured way. separately embedding the individual knowledge sources into vector spaces has demonstrated tremendous successes in encoding the respective knowledge , but how to jointly embed and reason with both knowledge sources to fully leverage the complementary information is still largely an open problem
