Learning Prototypical Functions for Physical Artifacts | Tianyu Jiang | humans create things for a reason. ancient people created spears for hunting , knives for cutting meat , pots for preparing food , etc. the prototypical function of a physical artifact is a kind of commonsense knowledge that we rely on to understand natural language. for example , if someone says “she borrowed the book” then you would assume that she intends to read the book , or if someone asks “can i use your knife \? ” then you would assume that they need to cut something. in this paper , we introduce a new nlp task of learning the prototypical uses for human-made physical objects. we use frames from framenet to represent a set of common functions for objects , and describe a manually annotated data set of physical objects labeled with their prototypical function. we also present experimental results for this task , including bert-based models that use predictions from masked patterns as well as artifact sense definitions from wordnet and frame definitions from framenet.
