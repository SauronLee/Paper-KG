Joint Models for Answer Verification in Question Answering Systems | Zeyu Zhang | this paper studies joint models for selecting correct answer sentences among the top k provided by answer sentence selection \( as2 \) modules , which are core components of retrieval-based question answering \( qa \) systems. our work shows that a critical step to effectively exploiting an answer set regards modeling the interrelated information between pair of answers. for this purpose , we build a three-way multi-classifier , which decides if an answer supports , refutes , or is neutral with respect to another one. more specifically , our neural architecture integrates a state-of-the-art as2 module with the multi-classifier , and a joint layer connecting all components. we tested our models on wikiqa , trec-qa , and a real-world dataset. the results show that our models obtain the new state of the art in as2.
