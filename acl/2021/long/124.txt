Topic-Driven and Knowledge-Aware Transformer for Dialogue Emotion Detection | Lixing Zhu | emotion detection in dialogues is challenging as it often requires the identification of thematic topics underlying a conversation , the relevant commonsense knowledge , and the intricate transition patterns between the affective states. in this paper , we propose a topic-driven knowledge-aware transformer to handle the challenges above. we firstly design a topic-augmented language model \( lm \) with an additional layer specialized for topic detection. the topic-augmented lm is then combined with commonsense statements derived from a knowledge base based on the dialogue contextual information. finally , a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture fuses the topical and commonsense information , and performs the emotion label sequence prediction. the model has been experimented on four datasets in dialogue emotion detection , demonstrating its superiority empirically over the existing state-of-the-art approaches. quantitative and qualitative results show that the model can discover topics which help in distinguishing emotion categories.
