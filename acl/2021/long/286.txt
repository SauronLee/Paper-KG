NeuralWOZ: Learning to Collect Task-Oriented Dialogue via Model-Based Simulation | Sungdong Kim | we propose neuralwoz , a novel dialogue collection framework that uses model-based dialogue simulation. neuralwoz has two pipelined models , collector and labeler. collector generates dialogues from \( 1 \) user’s goal instructions , which are the user context and task constraints in natural language , and \( 2 \) system’s api call results , which is a list of possible query responses for user requests from the given knowledge base. labeler annotates the generated dialogue by formulating the annotation as a multiple-choice problem , in which the candidate labels are extracted from goal instructions and api call results. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the zero-shot domain transfer learning for dialogue state tracking. in the evaluation , the synthetic dialogue corpus generated from neuralwoz achieves a new state-of-the-art with improvements of 4.4% point joint goal accuracy on average across domains , and improvements of 5.7% point of zero-shot coverage against the multiwoz 2.1 dataset.
