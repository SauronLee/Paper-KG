PASS: Perturb-and-Select Summarizer for Product Reviews | Nadav Oved | the product reviews summarization task aims to automatically produce a short summary for a set of reviews of a given product. such summaries are expected to aggregate a range of different opinions in a concise , coherent and informative manner. this challenging task gives rise to two shortcomings in existing work. first , summarizers tend to favor generic content that appears in reviews for many different products , resulting in template-like , less informative summaries. second , as reviewers often disagree on the pros and cons of a given product , summarizers sometimes yield inconsistent , self-contradicting summaries. we propose the pass system \( perturb-and-select summarizer \) that employs a large pre-trained transformer-based model \( t5 in our case \) , which follows a few-shot fine-tuning scheme. a key component of the pass system relies on applying systematic perturbations to the modelâ€™s input during inference , which allows it to generate multiple different summaries per product. we develop a method for ranking these summaries according to desired criteria , coherence in our case , enabling our system to almost entirely avoid the problem of self-contradiction. we compare our system against strong baselines on publicly available datasets , and show that it produces summaries which are more informative , diverse and coherent.
