De-biasing Distantly Supervised Named Entity Recognition via Causal Intervention | Wenkai Zhang | distant supervision tackles the data bottleneck in ner by automatically generating training instances via dictionary matching. unfortunately , the learning of ds-ner is severely dictionary-biased , which suffers from spurious correlations and therefore undermines the effectiveness and the robustness of the learned models. in this paper , we fundamentally explain the dictionary bias via a structural causal model \( scm \) , categorize the bias into intra-dictionary and inter-dictionary biases , and identify their causes. based on the scm , we learn de-biased ds-ner via causal interventions. for intra-dictionary bias , we conduct backdoor adjustment to remove the spurious correlations introduced by the dictionary confounder. for inter-dictionary bias , we propose a causal invariance regularizer which will make ds-ner models more robust to the perturbation of dictionaries. experiments on four datasets and three ds-ner models show that our method can significantly improve the performance of ds-ner.
