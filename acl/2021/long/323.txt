End-to-End AMR Coreference Resolution | Qiankun Fu | although parsing to abstract meaning representation \( amr \) has become very popular and amr has been shown effective on the many sentence-level downstream tasks , little work has studied how to generate amrs that can represent multi-sentence information. we introduce the first end-to-end amr coreference resolution model in order to build multi-sentence amrs. compared with the previous pipeline and rule-based approaches , our model alleviates error propagation and it is more robust for both in-domain and out-domain situations. besides , the document-level amrs obtained by our model can significantly improve over the amrs generated by a rule-based method \( liu et al. , 2015 \) on text summarization.
