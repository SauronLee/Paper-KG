PairRE: Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Paired Relation Vectors | Linlin Chao | distance based knowledge graph embedding methods show promising results on link prediction task , on which two topics have been widely studied: one is the ability to handle complex relations , such as n-to-1 , 1-to-n and n-to-n , the other is to encode various relation patterns , such as symmetry/antisymmetry. however , the existing methods fail to solve these two problems at the same time , which leads to unsatisfactory results. to mitigate this problem , we propose pairre , a model with paired vectors for each relation representation. the paired vectors enable an adaptive adjustment of the margin in loss function to fit for different complex relations. besides , pairre is capable of encoding three important relation patterns , symmetry/antisymmetry , inverse and composition. given simple constraints on relation representations , pairre can encode subrelation further. experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities of pairre. moreover , we set a new state-of-the-art on two knowledge graph datasets of the challenging open graph benchmark.
