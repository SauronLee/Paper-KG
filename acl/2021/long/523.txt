Metaphor Generation with Conceptual Mappings | Kevin Stowe | generating metaphors is a difficult task as it requires understanding nuanced relationships between abstract concepts. in this paper , we aim to generate a metaphoric sentence given a literal expression by replacing relevant verbs. guided by conceptual metaphor theory , we propose to control the generation process by encoding conceptual mappings between cognitive domains to generate meaningful metaphoric expressions. to achieve this , we develop two methods: 1 \) using framenet-based embeddings to learn mappings between domains and applying them at the lexical level \( cm-lex \) , and 2 \) deriving source/target pairs to train a controlled seq-to-seq generation model \( cm-bart \) . we assess our methods through automatic and human evaluation for basic metaphoricity and conceptual metaphor presence. we show that the unsupervised cm-lex model is competitive with recent deep learning metaphor generation systems , and cm-bart outperforms all other models both in automatic and human evaluations.
