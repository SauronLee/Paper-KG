R6	Attributes Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7	
T8	Definitions 454 759	seq2seq-du employs two bert-based encoders to respectively encode the utterances in the dialogue and the descriptions of schemas , an attender to calculate attentions between the utterance embeddings and the schema embeddings , and a decoder to generate pointers to represent the current state of dialogue
