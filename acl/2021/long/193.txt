OTTers: One-turn Topic Transitions for Open-Domain Dialogue | Karin Sevegnani | mixed initiative in open-domain dialogue requires a system to pro-actively introduce new topics. the one-turn topic transition task explores how a system connects two topics in a cooperative and coherent manner. the goal of the task is to generate a “bridging” utterance connecting the new topic to the topic of the previous conversation turn. we are especially interested in commonsense explanations of how a new topic relates to what has been mentioned before. we first collect a new dataset of human one-turn topic transitions , which we callotters. we then explore different strategies used by humans when asked to complete such a task , and notice that the use of a bridging utterance to connect the two topics is the approach used the most. we finally show how existing state-of-the-art text generation models can be adapted to this task and examine the performance of these baselines on different splits of the otters data.
