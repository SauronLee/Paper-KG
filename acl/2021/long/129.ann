T9	Definitions 580 996	\( 1 \) releasing a dataset of student-teacher exchanges extracted from us math classroom transcripts annotated for uptake by experts; \( 2 \) formalizing uptake as pointwise jensen-shannon divergence \( pjsd \) , estimated via next utterance classification; \( 3 \) conducting a linguistically-motivated comparison of different unsupervised measures and \( 4 \) correlating these measures with educational outcomes.
T10	Theories 997 1223	we find that although repetition captures a significant part of uptake , pjsd outperforms repetition-based baselines , as it is capable of identifying a wider range of uptake phenomena like question answering and reformulation
