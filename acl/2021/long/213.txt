Evaluating Evaluation Measures for Ordinal Classification and Ordinal Quantification | Tetsuya Sakai | ordinal classification \( oc \) is an important classification task where the classes are ordinal. for example , an oc task for sentiment analysis could have the following classes: highly positive , positive , neutral , negative , highly negative. clearly , evaluation measures for an oc task should penalise misclassifications by considering the ordinal nature of the classes. ordinal quantification \( oq \) is a related task where the gold data is a distribution over ordinal classes , and the system is required to estimate this distribution. evaluation measures for an oq task should also take the ordinal nature of the classes into account. however , for both oc and oq , there are only a small number of known evaluation measures that meet this basic requirement. in the present study , we utilise data from the semeval and ntcir communities to clarify the properties of nine evaluation measures in the context of oc tasks , and six measures in the context of oq tasks.
