Intent Classification and Slot Filling for Privacy Policies | Wasi Ahmad | understanding privacy policies is crucial for users as it empowers them to learn about the information that matters to them. sentences written in a privacy policy document explain privacy practices , and the constituent text spans convey further specific information about that practice. we refer to predicting the privacy practice explained in a sentence as intent classification and identifying the text spans sharing specific information as slot filling. in this work , we propose policyie , an english corpus consisting of 5 , 250 intent and 11 , 788 slot annotations spanning 31 privacy policies of websites and mobile applications. policyie corpus is a challenging real-world benchmark with limited labeled examples reflecting the cost of collecting large-scale annotations from domain experts. we present two alternative neural approaches as baselines , \( 1 \) intent classification and slot filling as a joint sequence tagging and \( 2 \) modeling them as a sequence-to-sequence \( seq2seq \) learning task. the experiment results show that both approaches perform comparably in intent classification , while the seq2seq method outperforms the sequence tagging approach in slot filling by a large margin. we perform a detailed error analysis to reveal the challenges of the proposed corpus.
