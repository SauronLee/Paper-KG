Multi-Label Few-Shot Learning for Aspect Category Detection | Mengting Hu | aspect category detection \( acd \) in sentiment analysis aims to identify the aspect categories mentioned in a sentence. in this paper , we formulate acd in the few-shot learning scenario. however , existing few-shot learning approaches mainly focus on single-label predictions. these methods can not work well for the acd task since a sentence may contain multiple aspect categories. therefore , we propose a multi-label few-shot learning method based on the prototypical network. to alleviate the noise , we design two effective attention mechanisms. the support-set attention aims to extract better prototypes by removing irrelevant aspects. the query-set attention computes multiple prototype-specific representations for each query instance , which are then used to compute accurate distances with the corresponding prototypes. to achieve multi-label inference , we further learn a dynamic threshold per instance by a policy network. extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms strong baselines.
