Neural Bi-Lexicalized PCFG Induction | Songlin Yang | neural lexicalized pcfgs \( l-pcfgs \) have been shown effective in grammar induction. however , to reduce computational complexity , they make a strong independence assumption on the generation of the child word and thus bilexical dependencies are ignored. in this paper , we propose an approach to parameterize l-pcfgs without making implausible independence assumptions. our approach directly models bilexical dependencies and meanwhile reduces both learning and representation complexities of l-pcfgs. experimental results on the english wsj dataset confirm the effectiveness of our approach in improving both running speed and unsupervised parsing performance.
