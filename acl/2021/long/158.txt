PIGLeT: Language Grounding Through Neuro-Symbolic Interaction in a 3D World | Rowan Zellers | we propose piglet: a model that learns physical commonsense knowledge through interaction , and then uses this knowledge to ground language. we factorize piglet into a physical dynamics model , and a separate language model. our dynamics model learns not just what objects are but also what they do: glass cups break when thrown , plastic ones donâ€™t. we then use it as the interface to our language model , giving us a unified model of linguistic form and grounded meaning. piglet can read a sentence , simulate neurally what might happen next , and then communicate that result through a literal symbolic representation , or natural language. experimental results show that our model effectively learns world dynamics , along with how to communicate them. it is able to correctly forecast what happens next given an english sentence over 80% of the time , outperforming a 100x larger , text-to-text approach by over 10%. likewise , its natural language summaries of physical interactions are also judged by humans as more accurate than lm alternatives. we present comprehensive analysis showing room for future work.
