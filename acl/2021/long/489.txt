Unleash GPT-2 Power for Event Detection | Amir Pouran Ben Veyseh | event detection \( ed \) aims to recognize mentions of events \( i.e. , event triggers \) and their types in text. recently , several ed datasets in various domains have been proposed. however , the major limitation of these resources is the lack of enough training data for individual event types which hinders the efficient training of data-hungry deep learning models. to overcome this issue , we propose to exploit the powerful pre-trained language model gpt-2 to generate training samples for ed. to prevent the noises inevitable in automatically generated data from hampering training process , we propose to exploit a teacher-student architecture in which the teacher is supposed to learn anchor knowledge from the original data. the student is then trained on combination of the original and gpt-generated data while being led by the anchor knowledge from the teacher. optimal transport is introduced to facilitate the anchor knowledge-based guidance between the two networks. we evaluate the proposed model on multiple ed benchmark datasets , gaining consistent improvement and establishing state-of-the-art results for ed.
