Unsupervised Out-of-Domain Detection via Pre-trained Transformers | Keyang Xu | deployed real-world machine learning applications are often subject to uncontrolled and even potentially malicious inputs. those out-of-domain inputs can lead to unpredictable outputs and sometimes catastrophic safety issues. prior studies on out-of-domain detection require in-domain task labels and are limited to supervised classification scenarios. our work tackles the problem of detecting out-of-domain samples with only unsupervised in-domain data. we utilize the latent representations of pre-trained transformers and propose a simple yet effective method to transform features across all layers to construct out-of-domain detectors efficiently. two domain-specific fine-tuning approaches are further proposed to boost detection accuracy. our empirical evaluations of related methods on two datasets validate that our method greatly improves out-of-domain detection ability in a more general scenario.
