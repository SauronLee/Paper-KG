Probabilistic, Structure-Aware Algorithms for Improved Variety, Accuracy, and Coverage of AMR Alignments | Austin Blodgett | we present algorithms for aligning components of abstract meaning representation \( amr \) graphs to spans in english sentences. we leverage unsupervised learning in combination with heuristics , taking the best of both worlds from previous amr aligners. our unsupervised models , however , are more sensitive to graph substructures , without requiring a separate syntactic parse. our approach covers a wider variety of amr substructures than previously considered , achieves higher coverage of nodes and edges , and does so with higher accuracy. we will release our leamr datasets and aligner for use in research on amr parsing , generation , and evaluation.
