Guiding the Growth: Difficulty-Controllable Question Generation through Step-by-Step Rewriting | Yi Cheng | this paper explores the task of difficulty-controllable question generation \( dcqg \) , which aims at generating questions with required difficulty levels. previous research on this task mainly defines the difficulty of a question as whether it can be correctly answered by a question answering \( qa \) system , lacking interpretability and controllability. in our work , we redefine question difficulty as the number of inference steps required to answer it and argue that question generation \( qg \) systems should have stronger control over the logic of generated questions. to this end , we propose a novel framework that progressively increases question difficulty through step-by-step rewriting under the guidance of an extracted reasoning chain. a dataset is automatically constructed to facilitate the research , on which extensive experiments are conducted to test the performance of our method.
