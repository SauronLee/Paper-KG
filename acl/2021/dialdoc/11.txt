Document-Grounded Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems on Pre-Trained Language Model with Diverse Input Representation | Boeun Kim | document-grounded goal-oriented dialog system understands users’ utterances , and generates proper responses by using information obtained from documents. the dialdoc21 shared task consists of two subtasks; subtask1 , finding text spans associated with users’ utterances from documents , and subtask2 , generating responses based on information obtained from subtask1. in this paper , we propose two models \( i.e. , a knowledge span prediction model and a response generation model \) for the subtask1 and the subtask2. in the subtask1 , dialogue act losses are used with roberta , and title embeddings are added to input representation of roberta. in the subtask2 , various special tokens and embeddings are added to input representation of bart’s encoder. then , we propose a method to assign different difficulty scores to leverage curriculum learning. in the subtask1 , our span prediction model achieved f1-scores of 74.81 \( ranked at top 7 \) and 73.41 \( ranked at top 5 \) in test-dev phase and test phase , respectively. in the subtask2 , our response generation model achieved sacrebleus of 37.50 \( ranked at top 3 \) and 41.06 \( ranked at top 1 \) in in test-dev phase and test phase , respectively.
