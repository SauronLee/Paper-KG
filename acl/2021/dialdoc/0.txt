DialDoc 2021 Shared Task: Goal-Oriented Document-grounded Dialogue Modeling | Song Feng | we present the results of shared task at workshop dialdoc 2021 that is focused on document-grounded dialogue and conversational question answering. the primary goal of this shared task is to build goal-oriented information-seeking conversation systems that can identify the most relevant knowledge in the associated document for generating agent responses in natural language. it includes two subtasks on predicting agent responses: the first subtask is to predict the grounding text span in the given document for next agent response; the second subtask is to generate agent response in natural language given the context. many submissions outperform baseline significantly. for the first task , the best-performing system achieved 67.1 exact match and 76.3 f1. for the second subtask , the best system achieved 41.1 sacrebleu and highest rank by human evaluation.
