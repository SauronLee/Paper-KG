Agenda Pushing in Email to Thwart Phishing | Hyundong Cho | in this work , we draw parallels between automatically responding to emails for combating social-engineering attacks and document-grounded response generation and lay out the blueprint of our approach. phishing emails are longer than dialogue utterances and often contain multiple intents. hence , we need to make decisions similar to those for document-grounded responses in deciding what parts of long text to use and how to address each intent to generate a knowledgeable multi-component response that pushes scammers towards agendas that aid in attribution and linking attacks. we propose , a hybrid system that uses customizable probabilistic finite state transducers to orchestrate pushing agendas coupled with neural dialogue systems that generate responses to unexpected prompts , as a promising solution to this end. we emphasize the need for this system by highlighting each componentâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and show how they complement each other.
