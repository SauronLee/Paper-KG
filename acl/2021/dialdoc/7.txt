Cascaded Span Extraction and Response Generation for Document-Grounded Dialog | Nico Daheim | this paper summarizes our entries to both subtasks of the first dialdoc shared task which focuses on the agent response prediction task in goal-oriented document-grounded dialogs. the task is split into two subtasks: predicting a span in a document that grounds an agent turn and generating an agent response based on a dialog and grounding document. in the first subtask , we restrict the set of valid spans to the ones defined in the dataset , use a biaffine classifier to model spans , and finally use an ensemble of different models. for the second sub-task , we use a cascaded model which grounds the response prediction on the predicted span instead of the full document. with these approaches , we obtain significant improvements in both subtasks compared to the baseline.
