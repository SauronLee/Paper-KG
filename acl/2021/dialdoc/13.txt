Building Goal-oriented Document-grounded Dialogue Systems | Xi Chen | in this paper , we describe our systems for solving the two doc2dial shared task: knowledge identification and response generation. we proposed several pre-processing and post-processing methods , and we experimented with data augmentation by pre-training the models on other relevant datasets. our best model for knowledge identification outperformed the baseline by 10.5+ f1-score on the test-dev split , and our best model for response generation outperformed the baseline by 11+ sacrebleu score on the test-dev split.
