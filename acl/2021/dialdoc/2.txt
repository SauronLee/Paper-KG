A Template-guided Hybrid Pointer Network for Knowledge-based Task-oriented Dialogue Systems | Dingmin Wang | most existing neural network based task-oriented dialog systems follow encoder-decoder paradigm , where the decoder purely depends on the source texts to generate a sequence of words , usually suffering from instability and poor readability. inspired by the traditional template-based generation approaches , we propose a template-guided hybrid pointer network for knowledge-based task-oriented dialog systems , which retrieves several potentially relevant answers from a pre-constructed domain-specific conversational repository as guidance answers , and incorporates the guidance answers into both the encoding and decoding processes. specifically , we design a memory pointer network model with a gating mechanism to fully exploit the semantic correlation between the retrieved answers and the ground-truth response. we evaluate our model on four widely used task-oriented datasets , including one simulated and three manually created datasets. the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art methods over different automatic evaluation metrics.
