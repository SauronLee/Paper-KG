The Climate Change Debate and Natural Language Processing | Manfred Stede | the debate around climate change \( cc \) —its extent , its causes , and the necessary responses—is intense and of global importance. yet , in the natural language processing \( nlp \) community , this domain has so far received little attention. in contrast , it is of enormous prominence in various social science disciplines , and some of that work follows the ”text-as-data” paradigm , seeking to employ quantitative methods for analyzing large amounts of cc-related text. other research is qualitative in nature and studies details , nuances , actors , and motivations within cc discourses. coming from both nlp and political science , and reviewing key works in both disciplines , we discuss how social science approaches to cc debates can inform advances in text-mining/nlp , and how , in return , nlp can support policy-makers and activists in making sense of large-scale and complex cc discourses across multiple genres , channels , topics , and communities. this is paramount for their ability to make rapid and meaningful impact on the discourse , and for shaping the necessary policy change.
