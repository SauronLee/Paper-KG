Dialogue Act Classification for Augmentative and Alternative Communication | E. Margaret Perkoff | augmentative and alternative communication \( aac \) devices and applications are intended to make it easier for individuals with complex communication needs to participate in conversations. however , these devices have low adoption and retention rates. we review prior work with text recommendation systems that have not been successful in mitigating these problems. to address these gaps , we propose applying dialogue act classification to aac conversations. we evaluated the performance of a state of the art model on a limited aac dataset that was trained on both aac and non-aac datasets. the one trained on aac \( accuracy = 38.6% \) achieved better performance than that trained on a non-aac corpus \( accuracy = 34.1% \) . these results reflect the need to incorporate representative datasets in later experiments. we discuss the need to collect more labeled aac datasets and propose areas of future work.
