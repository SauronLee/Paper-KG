A Grounded Well-being Conversational Agent with Multiple Interaction Modes: Preliminary Results | Xinxin Yan | technologies for enhancing well-being , healthcare vigilance and monitoring are on the rise. however , despite patient interest , such technologies suffer from low adoption. one hypothesis for this limited adoption is loss of human interaction that is central to doctor-patient encounters. in this paper we seek to address this limitation via a conversational agent that adopts one aspect of in-person doctor-patient interactions: a human avatar to facilitate medical grounded question answering. this is akin to the in-person scenario where the doctor may point to the human body or the patient may point to their own body to express their conditions. additionally , our agent has multiple interaction modes , that may give more options for the patient to use the agent , not just for medical question answering , but also to engage in conversations about general topics and current events. both the avatar , and the multiple interaction modes could help improve adherence. we present a high level overview of the design of our agent , marie bot wellbeing. we also report implementation details of our early prototype , and present preliminary results.
