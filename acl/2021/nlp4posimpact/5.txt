Are we human, or are we users? The role of natural language processing in human-centric news recommenders that nudge users to diverse content | Myrthe Reuver | in this position paper , we present a research agenda and ideas for facilitating exposure to diverse viewpoints in news recommendation. recommending news from diverse viewpoints is important to prevent potential filter bubble effects in news consumption , and stimulate a healthy democratic debate.to account for the complexity that is inherent to humans as citizens in a democracy , we anticipate \( among others \) individual-level differences in acceptance of diversity. we connect this idea to techniques in natural language processing , where distributional language models would allow us to place different users and news articles in a multidimensional space based on semantic content , where diversity is operationalized as distance and variance. in this way , we can model individual “latitudes of diversity” for different users , and thus personalize viewpoint diversity in support of a healthy public debate. in addition , we identify technical , ethical and conceptual issues related to our presented ideas. our investigation describes how nlp can play a central role in diversifying news recommendations.
