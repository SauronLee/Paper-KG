Time-Efficient Code Completion Model for the R Programming Language | Artem Popov | in this paper we present a deep learning code completion model for the r language. we introduce several techniques to utilize language modeling based architecture in the code completion task. with these techniques , the model requires low resources , but still achieves high quality. we also present an evaluation dataset for the r language completion task. our dataset contains multiple autocompletion usage contexts that provides robust validation results. the dataset is publicly available.
