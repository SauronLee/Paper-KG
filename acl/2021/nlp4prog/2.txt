CommitBERT: Commit Message Generation Using Pre-Trained Programming Language Model | Tae Hwan Jung | commit message is a document that summarizes source code changes in natural language. a good commit message clearly shows the source code changes , so this enhances collaboration between developers. therefore , our work is to develop a model that automatically writes the commit message. to this end , we release 345k datasets consisting of code modification and commit messages in six programming languages \( python , php , go , java , javascript , and ruby \) . similar to the neural machine translation \( nmt \) model , using our dataset , we feed the code modification to the encoder input and the commit message to the decoder input and measure the result of the generated commit message with bleu-4. also , we propose the following two training methods to improve the result of generating the commit message: \( 1 \) a method of preprocessing the input to feed the code modification to the encoder input. \( 2 \) a method that uses an initial weight suitable for the code domain to reduce the gap in contextual representation between programming language \( pl \) and natural language \( nl \) .
