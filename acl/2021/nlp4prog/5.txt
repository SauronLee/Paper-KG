DIRECT : A Transformer-based Model for Decompiled Identifier Renaming | Vikram Nitin | decompiling binary executables to high-level code is an important step in reverse engineering scenarios , such as malware analysis and legacy code maintenance. however , the generated high-level code is difficult to understand since the original variable names are lost. in this paper , we leverage transformer models to reconstruct the original variable names from decompiled code. inherent differences between code and natural language present certain challenges in applying conventional transformer-based architectures to variable name recovery. we propose direct , a novel transformer-based architecture customized specifically for the task at hand. we evaluate our model on a dataset of decompiled functions and find that direct outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by up to 20%. we also present ablation studies evaluating the impact of each of our modifications. we make the source code of direct available to encourage reproducible research.
