Shellcode_IA32: A Dataset for Automatic Shellcode Generation | Pietro Liguori | we take the first step to address the task of automatically generating shellcodes , i.e. , small pieces of code used as a payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability , starting from natural language comments. we assemble and release a novel dataset \( shellcode_ia32 \) , consisting of challenging but common assembly instructions with their natural language descriptions. we experiment with standard methods in neural machine translation \( nmt \) to establish baseline performance levels on this task.
