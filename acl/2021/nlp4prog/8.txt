Text-to-SQL in the Wild: A Naturally-Occurring Dataset Based on Stack Exchange Data | Moshe Hazoom | most available semantic parsing datasets , comprising of pairs of natural utterances and logical forms , were collected solely for the purpose of training and evaluation of natural language understanding systems. as a result , they do not contain any of the richness and variety of natural-occurring utterances , where humans ask about data they need or are curious about. in this work , we release sede , a dataset with 12 , 023 pairs of utterances and sql queries collected from real usage on the stack exchange website. we show that these pairs contain a variety of real-world challenges which were rarely reflected so far in any other semantic parsing dataset , propose an evaluation metric based on comparison of partial query clauses that is more suitable for real-world queries , and conduct experiments with strong baselines , showing a large gap between the performance on sede compared to other common datasets.
