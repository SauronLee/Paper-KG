Toward Diverse Precondition Generation | Heeyoung Kwon | a typical goal for language understanding is to logically connect the events of a discourse , but often connective events are not described due to their commonsense nature. in order to address this deficit , we focus here on generating precondition events. precondition generation can be framed as a sequence-to-sequence problem: given a target event , generate a possible precondition. however , in most real-world scenarios , an event can have several preconditions , which is not always suitable for standard seq2seq frameworks. we propose dip , the diverse precondition generation system that can generate unique and diverse preconditions. dip consists of three stages of the generative process â€“ an event sampler , a candidate generator , and a post-processor. the event sampler provides control codes \( precondition triggers \) which the candidate generator uses to focus its generation. post-processing further improves the results through re-ranking and filtering. unlike other conditional generation systems , dip automatically generates control codes without training on diverse examples. analysis reveals that dip improves the diversity of preconditions significantly compared to a beam search baseline. also , manual evaluation shows that dip generates more preconditions than a strong nucleus sampling baseline.
