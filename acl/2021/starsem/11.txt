InFillmore: Frame-Guided Language Generation with Bidirectional Context | Jiefu Ou | we propose a structured extension to bidirectional-context conditional language generation , or “infilling , ” inspired by frame semantic theory. guidance is provided through one of two approaches: \( 1 \) model fine-tuning , conditioning directly on observed symbolic frames , and \( 2 \) a novel extension to disjunctive lexically constrained decoding that leverages frame semantic lexical units. automatic and human evaluations confirm that frame-guided generation allows for explicit manipulation of intended infill semantics , with minimal loss in distinguishability from human-generated text. our methods flexibly apply to a variety of use scenarios , and we provide an interactive web demo.
