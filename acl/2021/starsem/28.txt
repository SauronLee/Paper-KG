Evaluating a Joint Training Approach for Learning Cross-lingual Embeddings with Sub-word Information without Parallel Corpora on Lower-resource Languages | Ali Hakimi Parizi | cross-lingual word embeddings provide a way for information to be transferred between languages. in this paper we evaluate an extension of a joint training approach to learning cross-lingual embeddings that incorporates sub-word information during training. this method could be particularly well-suited to lower-resource and morphologically-rich languages because it can be trained on modest size monolingual corpora , and is able to represent out-of-vocabulary words \( oovs \) . we consider bilingual lexicon induction , including an evaluation focused on oovs. we find that this method achieves improvements over previous approaches , particularly for oovs.
