Incorporating EDS Graph for AMR Parsing | Ziyi Shou | amr \( abstract meaning representation \) and eds \( elementary dependency structures \) are two popular meaning representations in nlp/nlu. amr is more abstract and conceptual , while eds is more low level , closer to the lexical structures of the given sentences. it is thus not surprising that eds parsing is easier than amr parsing. in this work , we consider using information from eds parsing to help improve the performance of amr parsing. we adopt a transition-based parser and propose to add eds graphs as additional semantic features using a graph encoder composed of lstm layer and gcn layer. our experimental results show that the additional information from eds parsing indeed gives a boost to the performance of the base amr parser used in our experiments.
