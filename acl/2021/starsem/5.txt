Generating Hypothetical Events for Abductive Inference | Debjit Paul | abductive reasoning starts from some observations and aims at finding the most plausible explanation for these observations. to perform abduction , humans often make use of temporal and causal inferences , and knowledge about how some hypothetical situation can result in different outcomes. this work offers the first study of how such knowledge impacts the abductive nli task – which consists in choosing the more likely explanation for given observations. we train a specialized language model lmi that is tasked to generate what could happen next from a hypothetical scenario that evolves from a given event. we then propose a multi-task model mtl to solve the abductive nli task , which predicts a plausible explanation by a \) considering different possible events emerging from candidate hypotheses – events generated by lmi – and b \) selecting the one that is most similar to the observed outcome. we show that our mtl model improves over prior vanilla pre-trained lms fine-tuned on abductive nli. our manual evaluation and analysis suggest that learning about possible next events from different hypothetical scenarios supports abductive inference.
