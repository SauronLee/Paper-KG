Semantic shift in social networks | Bill Noble | just as the meaning of words is tied to the communities in which they are used , so too is semantic change. but how does lexical semantic change manifest differently across different communities \? in this work , we investigate the relationship between community structure and semantic change in 45 communities from the social media website reddit. we use distributional methods to quantify lexical semantic change and induce a social network on communities , based on interactions between members. we explore the relationship between semantic change and the clustering coefficient of a communityâ€™s social network graph , as well as community size and stability. while none of these factors are found to be significant on their own , we report a significant effect of their three-way interaction. we also report on significant word-level effects of frequency and change in frequency , which replicate previous findings.
