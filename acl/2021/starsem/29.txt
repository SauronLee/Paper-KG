Adversarial Training for Machine Reading Comprehension with Virtual Embeddings | Ziqing Yang | adversarial training \( at \) as a regularization method has proved its effectiveness on various tasks. though there are successful applications of at on some nlp tasks , the distinguishing characteristics of nlp tasks have not been exploited. in this paper , we aim to apply at on machine reading comprehension \( mrc \) tasks. furthermore , we adapt at for mrc tasks by proposing a novel adversarial training method called pqat that perturbs the embedding matrix instead of word vectors. to differentiate the roles of passages and questions , pqat uses additional virtual p/q-embedding matrices to gather the global perturbations of words from passages and questions separately. we test the method on a wide range of mrc tasks , including span-based extractive rc and multiple-choice rc. the results show that adversarial training is effective universally , and pqat further improves the performance.
