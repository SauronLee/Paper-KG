A Study on Using Semantic Word Associations to Predict the Success of a Novel | Syeda Jannatus Saba | many new books get published every year , and only a fraction of them become popular among the readers. so the prediction of a book success can be a very useful parameter for publishers to make a reliable decision. this article presents the study of semantic word associations using the word embedding of book content for a set of roget’s thesaurus concepts for book success prediction. in this work , we discuss the method to represent a book as a spectrum of concepts based on the association score between its content embedding and a global embedding \( i.e. fasttext \) for a set of semantically linked word clusters. we show that the semantic word associations outperform the previous methods for book success prediction. in addition , we present that semantic word associations also provide better results than using features like the frequency of word groups in roget’s thesaurus , liwc \( a popular tool for linguistic inquiry and word count \) , nrc \( word association emotion lexicon \) , and part of speech \( pos \) . our study reports that concept associations based on roget’s thesaurus using word embedding of individual novel resulted in the state-of-the-art performance of 0.89 average weighted f1-score for book success prediction. finally , we present a set of dominant themes that contribute towards the popularity of a book for a specific genre.
