Dependency Patterns of Complex Sentences and Semantic Disambiguation for Abstract Meaning Representation Parsing | Yuki Yamamoto | abstract meaning representation \( amr \) is a sentence-level meaning representation based on predicate argument structure. one of the challenges we find in amr parsing is to capture the structure of complex sentences which expresses the relation between predicates. knowing the core part of the sentence structure in advance may be beneficial in such a task. in this paper , we present a list of dependency patterns for english complex sentence constructions designed for amr parsing. with a dedicated pattern matcher , all occurrences of complex sentence constructions are retrieved from an input sentence. while some of the subordinators have semantic ambiguities , we deal with this problem through training classification models on data derived from amr and wikipedia corpus , establishing a new baseline for future works. the developed complex sentence patterns and the corresponding amr descriptions will be made public.
