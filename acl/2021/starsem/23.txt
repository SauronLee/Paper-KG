Compound or Term Features? Analyzing Salience in Predicting the Difficulty of German Noun Compounds across Domains | Anna Hätty | predicting the difficulty of domain-specific vocabulary is an important task towards a better understanding of a domain , and to enhance the communication between lay people and experts. we investigate german closed noun compounds and focus on the interaction of compound-based lexical features \( such as frequency and productivity \) and terminology-based features \( contrasting domain-specific and general language \) across word representations and classifiers. our prediction experiments complement insights from classification using \( a \) manually designed features to characterise termhood and compound formation and \( b \) compound and constituent word embeddings. we find that for a broad binary distinction into ‘easy’ vs. ‘difficult’ general-language compound frequency is sufficient , but for a more fine-grained four-class distinction it is crucial to include contrastive termhood features and compound and constituent features.
