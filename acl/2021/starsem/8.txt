ParsFEVER: a Dataset for Farsi Fact Extraction and Verification | Majid Zarharan | training and evaluation of automatic fact extraction and verification techniques require large amounts of annotated data which might not be available for low-resource languages. this paper presents parsfever: the first publicly available farsi dataset for fact extraction and verification. we adopt the construction procedure of the standard english dataset for the task , i.e. , fever , and improve it for the case of low-resource languages. specifically , claims are extracted from sentences that are carefully selected to be more informative. the dataset comprises nearly 23k manually-annotated claims. over 65% of the claims in parsfever are many-hop \( require evidence from multiple sources \) , making the dataset a challenging benchmark \( only 13% of the claims in fever are many-hop \) . also , despite having a smaller training set \( around one-ninth of that in fever \) , a model trained on parsfever attains similar downstream performance , indicating the quality of the dataset. we release the dataset and the annotation guidelines at https://github.com/zarharan/parsfever.
