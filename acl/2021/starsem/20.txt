Neural Metaphor Detection with Visibility Embeddings | Gitit Kehat | we present new results for the problem of sequence metaphor labeling , using the recently developed visibility embeddings. we show that concatenating such embeddings to the input of a bilstm obtains consistent and significant improvements at almost no cost , and we present further improved results when visibility embeddings are combined with bert.
