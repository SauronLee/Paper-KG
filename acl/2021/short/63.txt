Towards Generative Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis | Wenxuan Zhang | aspect-based sentiment analysis \( absa \) has received increasing attention recently. most existing work tackles absa in a discriminative manner , designing various task-specific classification networks for the prediction. despite their effectiveness , these methods ignore the rich label semantics in absa problems and require extensive task-specific designs. in this paper , we propose to tackle various absa tasks in a unified generative framework. two types of paradigms , namely annotation-style and extraction-style modeling , are designed to enable the training process by formulating each absa task as a text generation problem. we conduct experiments on four absa tasks across multiple benchmark datasets where our proposed generative approach achieves new state-of-the-art results in almost all cases. this also validates the strong generality of the proposed framework which can be easily adapted to arbitrary absa task without additional task-specific model design.
