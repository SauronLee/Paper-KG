Thank you BART! Rewarding Pre-Trained Models Improves Formality Style Transfer | Huiyuan Lai | scarcity of parallel data causes formality style transfer models to have scarce success in preserving content. we show that fine-tuning pre-trained language \( gpt-2 \) and sequence-to-sequence \( bart \) models boosts content preservation , and that this is possible even with limited amounts of parallel data. augmenting these models with rewards that target style and content –the two core aspects of the task– we achieve a new state-of-the-art.
