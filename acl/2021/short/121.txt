Multi-Scale Progressive Attention Network for Video Question Answering | Zhicheng Guo | understanding the multi-scale visual information in a video is essential for video question answering \( videoqa \) . therefore , we propose a novel multi-scale progressive attention network \( mspan \) to achieve relational reasoning between cross-scale video information. we construct clips of different lengths to represent different scales of the video. then , the clip-level features are aggregated into node features by using max-pool , and a graph is generated for each scale of clips. for cross-scale feature interaction , we design a message passing strategy between adjacent scale graphs , i.e. , top-down scale interaction and bottom-up scale interaction. under the questionâ€™s guidance of progressive attention , we realize the fusion of all-scale video features. experimental evaluations on three benchmarks: tgif-qa , msvd-qa and msrvtt-qa show our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance.
