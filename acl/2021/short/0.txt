Catchphrase: Automatic Detection of Cultural References | Nir Sweed | a snowclone is a customizable phrasal template that can be realized in multiple , instantly recognized variants. for example , â€œ* is the new *" \( orange is the new black , 40 is the new 30 \) . snowclones are extensively used in social media. in this paper , we study snowclones originating from pop-culture quotes; our goal is to automatically detect cultural references in text. we introduce a new , publicly available data set of pop-culture quotes and their corresponding snowclone usages and train models on them. we publish code for catchphrase , an internet browser plugin to automatically detect and mark references in real-time , and examine its performance via a user study. aside from assisting people to better comprehend cultural references , we hope that detecting snowclones can complement work on paraphrasing and help tackling long-standing questions in social science about the dynamics of information propagation.
