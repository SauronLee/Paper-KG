An Empirical Study on Adversarial Attack on NMT: Languages and Positions Matter | Zhiyuan Zeng | in this paper , we empirically investigate adversarial attack on nmt from two aspects: languages \( the source vs. the target language \) and positions \( front vs. rear \) . for autoregressive nmt models that generate target words from left to right , we observe that adversarial attack on the source language is more effective than on the target language , and that attacking front positions of target sentences or positions of source sentences aligned to the front positions of corresponding target sentences is more effective than attacking other positions. we further exploit the attention distribution of the victim model to attack source sentences at positions that have a strong association with front target words. experiment results demonstrate that our attention-based adversarial attack is more effective than adversarial attacks by sampling positions randomly or according to gradients.
