A Span-based Dynamic Local Attention Model for Sequential Sentence Classification | Xichen Shang | sequential sentence classification aims to classify each sentence in the document based on the context in which sentences appear. most existing work addresses this problem using a hierarchical sequence labeling network. however , they ignore considering the latent segment structure of the document , in which contiguous sentences often have coherent semantics. in this paper , we proposed a span-based dynamic local attention model that could explicitly capture the structural information by the proposed supervised dynamic local attention. we further introduce an auxiliary task called span-based classification to explore the span-level representations. extensive experiments show that our model achieves better or competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmark datasets.
