MedNLI Is Not Immune: Natural Language Inference Artifacts in the Clinical Domain | Christine Herlihy | crowdworker-constructed natural language inference \( nli \) datasets have been found to contain statistical artifacts associated with the annotation process that allow hypothesis-only classifiers to achieve better-than-random performance \( citation \) . we investigate whether mednli , a physician-annotated dataset with premises extracted from clinical notes , contains such artifacts \( citation \) . we find that entailed hypotheses contain generic versions of specific concepts in the premise , as well as modifiers related to responsiveness , duration , and probability. neutral hypotheses feature conditions and behaviors that co-occur with , or cause , the condition \( s \) in the premise. contradiction hypotheses feature explicit negation of the premise and implicit negation via assertion of good health. adversarial filtering demonstrates that performance degrades when evaluated on the
