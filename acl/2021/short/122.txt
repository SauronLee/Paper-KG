Efficient Passage Retrieval with Hashing for Open-domain Question Answering | Ikuya Yamada | most state-of-the-art open-domain question answering systems use a neural retrieval model to encode passages into continuous vectors and extract them from a knowledge source. however , such retrieval models often require large memory to run because of the massive size of their passage index. in this paper , we introduce binary passage retriever \( bpr \) , a memory-efficient neural retrieval model that integrates a learning-to-hash technique into the state-of-the-art dense passage retriever \( dpr \) to represent the passage index using compact binary codes rather than continuous vectors. bpr is trained with a multi-task objective over two tasks: efficient candidate generation based on binary codes and accurate reranking based on continuous vectors. compared with dpr , bpr substantially reduces the memory cost from 65gb to 2gb without a loss of accuracy on two standard open-domain question answering benchmarks: natural questions and triviaqa. our code and trained models are available at https://github.com/studio-ousia/bpr.
