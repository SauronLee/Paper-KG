Uncertainty and Surprisal Jointly Deliver the Punchline: Exploiting Incongruity-Based Features for Humor Recognition | Yubo Xie | humor recognition has been widely studied as a text classification problem using data-driven approaches. however , most existing work does not examine the actual joke mechanism to understand humor. we break down any joke into two distinct components: the set-up and the punchline , and further explore the special relationship between them. inspired by the incongruity theory of humor , we model the set-up as the part developing semantic uncertainty , and the punchline disrupting audience expectations. with increasingly powerful language models , we were able to feed the set-up along with the punchline into the gpt-2 language model , and calculate the uncertainty and surprisal values of the jokes. by conducting experiments on the semeval 2021 task 7 dataset , we found that these two features have better capabilities of telling jokes from non-jokes , compared with existing baselines.
