Machine Translation into Low-resource Language Varieties | Sachin Kumar | state-of-the-art machine translation \( mt \) systems are typically trained to generate “standard” target language; however , many languages have multiple varieties \( regional varieties , dialects , sociolects , non-native varieties \) that are different from the standard language. such varieties are often low-resource , and hence do not benefit from contemporary nlp solutions , mt included. we propose a general framework to rapidly adapt mt systems to generate language varieties that are close to , but different from , the standard target language , using no parallel \( source–variety \) data. this also includes adaptation of mt systems to low-resource typologically-related target languages. we experiment with adapting an english–russian mt system to generate ukrainian and belarusian , an english–norwegian bokmål system to generate nynorsk , and an english–arabic system to generate four arabic dialects , obtaining significant improvements over competitive baselines.
