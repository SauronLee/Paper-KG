Improving Model Generalization: A Chinese Named Entity Recognition Case Study | Guanqing Liang | generalization is an important ability that helps to ensure that a machine learning model can perform well on unseen data. in this paper , we study the effect of data bias on model generalization , using chinese named entity recognition \( ner \) as a case study. specifically , we analyzed five benchmarking datasets for chinese ner , and observed the following two types of data bias that can compromise model generalization ability. firstly , the test sets of all the five datasets contain a significant proportion of entities that have been seen in the training sets. such test data would therefore not be able to reflect the true generalization ability of a model. secondly , all datasets are dominated by a few fat-head entities , i.e. , entities appearing with particularly high frequency. as a result , a model might be able to produce high prediction accuracy simply by keyword memorization without leveraging context knowledge. to address these data biases , we first refine each test set by excluding seen entities from it , so as to better evaluate a model’s generalization ability. then , we propose a simple yet effective entity resampling method to make entities within the same category distributed equally , encouraging a model to leverage both name and context knowledge in the training process. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed entity resampling method significantly improves a model’s ability in detecting unseen entities , especially for company , organization and position categories.
