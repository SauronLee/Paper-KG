X-Fact: A New Benchmark Dataset for Multilingual Fact Checking | Ashim Gupta | in this work , we introduce : the largest publicly available multilingual dataset for factual verification of naturally existing real-world claims. the dataset contains short statements in 25 languages and is labeled for veracity by expert fact-checkers. the dataset includes a multilingual evaluation benchmark that measures both out-of-domain generalization , and zero-shot capabilities of the multilingual models. using state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models , we develop several automated fact-checking models that , along with textual claims , make use of additional metadata and evidence from news stories retrieved using a search engine. empirically , our best model attains an f-score of around 40% , suggesting that our dataset is a challenging benchmark for the evaluation of multilingual fact-checking models.
