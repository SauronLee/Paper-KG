Towards Visual Question Answering on Pathology Images | Xuehai He | pathology imaging is broadly used for identifying the causes and effects of diseases or injuries. given a pathology image , being able to answer questions about the clinical findings contained in the image is very important for medical decision making. in this paper , we aim to develop a pathological visual question answering framework to analyze pathology images and answer medical questions related to these images. to build such a framework , we create pathvqa , a vqa dataset with 32 , 795 questions asked from 4 , 998 pathology images. we also propose a three-level optimization framework which performs self-supervised pretraining and vqa finetuning end-to-end to learn powerful visual and textual representations jointly and automatically identifies and excludes noisy self-supervised examples from pretraining. we perform experiments on our created pathvqa dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. the datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ucsd-ai4h/pathvqa
