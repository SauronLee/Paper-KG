Explicitly Capturing Relations between Entity Mentions via Graph Neural Networks for Domain-specific Named Entity Recognition | Pei Chen | named entity recognition \( ner \) is well studied for the general domain , and recent systems have achieved human-level performance for identifying common entity types. however , the ner performance is still moderate for specialized domains that tend to feature complicated contexts and jargonistic entity types. to address these challenges , we propose explicitly connecting entity mentions based on both global coreference relations and local dependency relations for building better entity mention representations. in our experiments , we incorporate entity mention relations by graph neural networks and show that our system noticeably improves the ner performance on two datasets from different domains. we further show that the proposed lightweight system can effectively elevate the ner performance to a higher level even when only a tiny amount of labeled data is available , which is desirable for domain-specific ner.
