DuReader_robust: A Chinese Dataset Towards Evaluating Robustness and Generalization of Machine Reading Comprehension in Real-World Applications | Hongxuan Tang | machine reading comprehension \( mrc \) is a crucial task in natural language processing and has achieved remarkable advancements. however , most of the neural mrc models are still far from robust and fail to generalize well in real-world applications. in order to comprehensively verify the robustness and generalization of mrc models , we introduce a real-world chinese dataset â€“ dureader_robust . it is designed to evaluate the mrc models from three aspects: over-sensitivity , over-stability and generalization. comparing to previous work , the instances in dureader_robust are natural texts , rather than the altered unnatural texts. it presents the challenges when applying mrc models to real-world applications. the experimental results show that mrc models do not perform well on the challenge test set. moreover , we analyze the behavior of existing models on the challenge test set , which may provide suggestions for future model development. the dataset and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/baidu/dureader.
