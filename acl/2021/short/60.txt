Zero-shot Fact Verification by Claim Generation | Liangming Pan | neural models for automated fact verification have achieved promising results thanks to the availability of large , human-annotated datasets. however , for each new domain that requires fact verification , creating a dataset by manually writing claims and linking them to their supporting evidence is expensive. we develop qacg , a framework for training a robust fact verification model by using automatically generated claims that can be supported , refuted , or unverifiable from evidence from wikipedia. qacg generates question-answer pairs from the evidence and then converts them into different types of claims. experiments on the fever dataset show that our qacg framework significantly reduces the demand for human-annotated training data. in a zero-shot scenario , qacg improves a roberta modelâ€™s f1 from 50% to 77% , equivalent in performance to 2k+ manually-curated examples. our qacg code is publicly available.
