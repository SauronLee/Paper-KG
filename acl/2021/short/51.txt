DefSent: Sentence Embeddings using Definition Sentences | Hayato Tsukagoshi | sentence embedding methods using natural language inference \( nli \) datasets have been successfully applied to various tasks. however , these methods are only available for limited languages due to relying heavily on the large nli datasets. in this paper , we propose defsent , a sentence embedding method that uses definition sentences from a word dictionary , which performs comparably on unsupervised semantics textual similarity \( sts \) tasks and slightly better on senteval tasks than conventional methods. since dictionaries are available for many languages , defsent is more broadly applicable than methods using nli datasets without constructing additional datasets. we demonstrate that defsent performs comparably on unsupervised semantics textual similarity \( sts \) tasks and slightly better on senteval tasks to the methods using large nli datasets. our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hpprc/defsent.
