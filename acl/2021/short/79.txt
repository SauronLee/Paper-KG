Embedding Time Differences in Context-sensitive Neural Networks for Learning Time to Event | Nazanin Dehghani | we propose an effective context-sensitive neural model for time to event \( tte \) prediction task , which aims to predict the amount of time to/from the occurrence of given events in streaming content. we investigate this problem in the context of a multi-task learning framework , which we enrich with time difference embeddings. in addition , we develop a multi-genre dataset of english events about soccer competitions and academy awards ceremonies , and their relevant tweets obtained from twitter. our model is 1.4 and 3.3 hours more accurate than the current state-of-the-art model in estimating tte on english and dutch tweets respectively. we examine different aspects of our model to illustrate its source of improvement.
