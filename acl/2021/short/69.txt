More than Text: Multi-modal Chinese Word Segmentation | Dong Zhang | chinese word segmentation \( cws \) is undoubtedly an important basic task in natural language processing. previous works only focus on the textual modality , but there are often audio and video utterances \( such as news broadcast and face-to-face dialogues \) , where textual , acoustic and visual modalities normally exist. to this end , we attempt to combine the multi-modality \( mainly the converted text and actual voice information \) to perform cws. in this paper , we annotate a new dataset for cws containing text and audio. moreover , we propose a time-dependent multi-modal interactive model based on transformer framework to integrate multi-modal information for word sequence labeling. the experimental results on three different training sets show the effectiveness of our approach with fusing text and audio.
