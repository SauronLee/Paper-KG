Enhancing Entity Boundary Detection for Better Chinese Named Entity Recognition | Chun Chen | in comparison with english , due to the lack of explicit word boundary and tenses information , chinese named entity recognition \( ner \) is much more challenging. in this paper , we propose a boundary enhanced approach for better chinese ner. in particular , our approach enhances the boundary information from two perspectives. on one hand , we enhance the representation of the internal dependency of phrases by an additional graph attention network \( gat \) layer. on the other hand , taking the entity head-tail prediction \( i.e. , boundaries \) as an auxiliary task , we propose an unified framework to learn the boundary information and recognize the ne jointly. experiments on both the ontonotes and the weibo corpora show the effectiveness of our approach.
