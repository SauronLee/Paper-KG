Quotation Recommendation and Interpretation Based on Transformation from Queries to Quotations | Lingzhi Wang | to help individuals express themselves better , quotation recommendation is receiving growing attention. nevertheless , most prior efforts focus on modeling quotations and queries separately and ignore the relationship between the quotations and the queries. in this work , we introduce a transformation matrix that directly maps the query representations to quotation representations. to better learn the mapping relationship , we employ a mapping loss that minimizes the distance of two semantic spaces \( one for quotation and another for mapped-query \) . furthermore , we explore using the words in history queries to interpret the figurative language of quotations , where quotation-aware attention is applied on top of history queries to highlight the indicator words. experiments on two datasets in english and chinese show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.
