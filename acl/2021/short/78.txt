Towards more equitable question answering systems: How much more data do you need? | Arnab Debnath | question answering \( qa \) in english has been widely explored , but multilingual datasets are relatively new , with several methods attempting to bridge the gap between high- and low-resourced languages using data augmentation through translation and cross-lingual transfer. in this project we take a step back and study which approaches allow us to take the most advantage of existing resources in order to produce qa systems in many languages. specifically , we perform extensive analysis to measure the efficacy of few-shot approaches augmented with automatic translations and permutations of context-question-answer pairs. in addition , we make suggestions for future dataset development efforts that make better use of a fixed annotation budget , with a goal of increasing the language coverage of qa datasets and systems.
