Question Generation for Adaptive Education | Megha Srivastava | intelligent and adaptive online education systems aim to make high-quality education available for a diverse range of students. however , existing systems usually depend on a pool of hand-made questions , limiting how fine-grained and open-ended they can be in adapting to individual students. we explore targeted question generation as a controllable sequence generation task. we first show how to fine-tune pre-trained language models for deep knowledge tracing \( lm-kt \) . this model accurately predicts the probability of a student answering a question correctly , and generalizes to questions not seen in training. we then use lm-kt to specify the objective and data for training a model to generate questions conditioned on the student and target difficulty. our results show we succeed at generating novel , well-calibrated language translation questions for second language learners from a real online education platform.
