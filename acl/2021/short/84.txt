Targeting the Benchmark: On Methodology in Current Natural Language Processing Research | David Schlangen | it has become a common pattern in our field: one group introduces a language task , exemplified by a dataset , which they argue is challenging enough to serve as a benchmark. they also provide a baseline model for it , which then soon is improved upon by other groups. often , research efforts then move on , and the pattern repeats itself. what is typically left implicit is the argumentation for why this constitutes progress , and progress towards what. in this paper , we try to step back for a moment from this pattern and work out possible argumentations and their parts.
