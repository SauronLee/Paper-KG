Improving Compositional Generalization in Classification Tasks via Structure Annotations | Juyong Kim | compositional generalization is the ability to generalize systematically to a new data distribution by combining known components. although humans seem to have a great ability to generalize compositionally , state-of-the-art neural models struggle to do so. in this work , we study compositional generalization in classification tasks and present two main contributions. first , we study ways to convert a natural language sequence-to-sequence dataset to a classification dataset that also requires compositional generalization. second , we show that providing structural hints \( specifically , providing parse trees and entity links as attention masks for a transformer model \) helps compositional generalization.
