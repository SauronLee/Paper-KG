An Exploratory Analysis of Multilingual Word-Level Quality Estimation with Cross-Lingual Transformers | Tharindu Ranasinghe | most studies on word-level quality estimation \( qe \) of machine translation focus on language-specific models. the obvious disadvantages of these approaches are the need for labelled data for each language pair and the high cost required to maintain several language-specific models. to overcome these problems , we explore different approaches to multilingual , word-level qe. we show that multilingual qe models perform on par with the current language-specific models. in the cases of zero-shot and few-shot qe , we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict word-level quality for any given new language pair from models trained on other language pairs. our findings suggest that the word-level qe models based on powerful pre-trained transformers that we propose in this paper generalise well across languages , making them more useful in real-world scenarios.
