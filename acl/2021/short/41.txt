Zero-shot Event Extraction via Transfer Learning: Challenges and Insights | Qing Lyu | event extraction has long been a challenging task , addressed mostly with supervised methods that require expensive annotation and are not extensible to new event ontologies. in this work , we explore the possibility of zero-shot event extraction by formulating it as a set of textual entailment \( te \) and/or question answering \( qa \) queries \( e.g. “a city was attacked” entails “there is an attack” \) , exploiting pretrained te/qa models for direct transfer. on ace-2005 and ere , our system achieves acceptable results , yet there is still a large gap from supervised approaches , showing that current qa and te technologies fail in transferring to a different domain. to investigate the reasons behind the gap , we analyze the remaining key challenges , their respective impact , and possible improvement directions.
