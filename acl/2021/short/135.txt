SaRoCo: Detecting Satire in a Novel Romanian Corpus of News Articles | Ana-Cristina Rogoz | in this work , we introduce a corpus for satire detection in romanian news. we gathered 55 , 608 public news articles from multiple real and satirical news sources , composing one of the largest corpora for satire detection regardless of language and the only one for the romanian language. we provide an official split of the text samples , such that training news articles belong to different sources than test news articles , thus ensuring that models do not achieve high performance simply due to overfitting. we conduct experiments with two state-of-the-art deep neural models , resulting in a set of strong baselines for our novel corpus. our results show that the machine-level accuracy for satire detection in romanian is quite low \( under 73% on the test set \) compared to the human-level accuracy \( 87% \) , leaving enough room for improvement in future research.
