Preview, Attend and Review: Schema-Aware Curriculum Learning for Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking | Yinpei Dai | existing dialog state tracking \( dst \) models are trained with dialog data in a random order , neglecting rich structural information in a dataset. in this paper , we propose to use curriculum learning \( cl \) to better leverage both the curriculum structure and schema structure for task-oriented dialogs. specifically , we propose a model-agnostic framework called schema-aware curriculum learning for dialog state tracking \( saclog \) , which consists of a preview module that pre-trains a dst model with schema information , a curriculum module that optimizes the model with cl , and a review module that augments mispredicted data to reinforce the cl training. we show that our proposed approach improves dst performance over both a transformer-based and rnn-based dst model \( trippy and trade \) and achieves new state-of-the-art results on woz2.0 and multiwoz2.1.
