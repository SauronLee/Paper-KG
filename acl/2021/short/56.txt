Training Adaptive Computation for Open-Domain Question Answering with Computational Constraints | Yuxiang Wu | adaptive computation \( ac \) has been shown to be effective in improving the efficiency of open-domain question answering \( odqa \) systems. however , the current ac approaches require tuning of all model parameters , and training state-of-the-art odqa models requires significant computational resources that may not be available for most researchers. we propose adaptive passage encoder , an ac method that can be applied to an existing odqa model and can be trained efficiently on a single gpu. it keeps the parameters of the base odqa model fixed , but it overrides the default layer-by-layer computation of the encoder with an ac policy that is trained to optimise the computational efficiency of the model. our experimental results show that our method improves upon a state-of-the-art model on two datasets , and is also more accurate than previous ac methods due to the stronger base odqa model. all source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/uclnlp/ape.
