Distinct Label Representations for Few-Shot Text Classification | Sora Ohashi | few-shot text classification aims to classify inputs whose label has only a few examples. previous studies overlooked the semantic relevance between label representations. therefore , they are easily confused by labels that are relevant. to address this problem , we propose a method that generates distinct label representations that embed information specific to each label. our method is applicable to conventional few-shot classification models. experimental results show that our method significantly improved the performance of few-shot text classification across models and datasets.
