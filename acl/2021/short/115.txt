Entity Enhancement for Implicit Discourse Relation Classification in the Biomedical Domain | Wei Shi | implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task , in particular when the text domain is different from the standard penn discourse treebank \( pdtb; prasad et al. , 2008 \) training corpus domain \( wall street journal in 1990s \) . we here tackle the task of implicit discourse relation classification on the biomedical domain , for which the biomedical discourse relation bank \( biodrb; prasad et al. , 2011 \) is available. we show that entity information can be used to improve discourse relational argument representation. in a first step , we show that explicitly marked instances that are content-wise similar to the target relations can be used to achieve good performance in the cross-domain setting using a simple unsupervised voting pipeline. as a further step , we show that with the linked entity information from the first step , a transformer which is augmented with entity-related information \( kbert; liu et al. , 2020 \) sets the new state of the art performance on the dataset , outperforming the large pre-trained biobert \( lee et al. , 2020 \) model by 2% points.
