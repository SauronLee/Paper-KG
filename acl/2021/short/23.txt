Whatâ€™s in the Box? An Analysis of Undesirable Content in the Common Crawl Corpus | Alexandra Luccioni | whereas much of the success of the current generation of neural language models has been driven by increasingly large training corpora , relatively little research has been dedicated to analyzing these massive sources of textual data. in this exploratory analysis , we delve deeper into the common crawl , a colossal web corpus that is extensively used for training language models. we find that it contains a significant amount of undesirable content , including hate speech and sexually explicit content , even after filtering procedures. we discuss the potential impacts of this content on language models and conclude with future research directions and a more mindful approach to corpus collection and analysis.
