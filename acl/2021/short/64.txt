Bilingual Mutual Information Based Adaptive Training for Neural Machine Translation | Yangyifan Xu | recently , token-level adaptive training has achieved promising improvement in machine translation , where the cross-entropy loss function is adjusted by assigning different training weights to different tokens , in order to alleviate the token imbalance problem. however , previous approaches only use static word frequency information in the target language without considering the source language , which is insufficient for bilingual tasks like machine translation. in this paper , we propose a novel bilingual mutual information \( bmi \) based adaptive objective , which measures the learning difficulty for each target token from the perspective of bilingualism , and assigns an adaptive weight accordingly to improve token-level adaptive training. this method assigns larger training weights to tokens with higher bmi , so that easy tokens are updated with coarse granularity while difficult tokens are updated with fine granularity. experimental results on wmt14 english-to-german and wmt19 chinese-to-english demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with the transformer baseline and previous token-level adaptive training approaches. further analyses confirm that our method can improve the lexical diversity.
