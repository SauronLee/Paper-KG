Weakly-Supervised Methods for Suicide Risk Assessment: Role of Related Domains | Chenghao Yang | social media has become a valuable resource for the study of suicidal ideation and the assessment of suicide risk. among social media platforms , reddit has emerged as the most promising one due to its anonymity and its focus on topic-based communities \( subreddits \) that can be indicative of someoneâ€™s state of mind or interest regarding mental health disorders such as r/suicidewatch , r/anxiety , r/depression. a challenge for previous work on suicide risk assessment has been the small amount of labeled data. we propose an empirical investigation into several classes of weakly-supervised approaches , and show that using pseudo-labeling based on related issues around mental health \( e.g. , anxiety , depression \) helps improve model performance for suicide risk assessment.
