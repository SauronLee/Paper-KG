Replicating and Extending “Because Their Treebanks Leak”: Graph Isomorphism, Covariants, and Parser Performance | Mark Anderson | søgaard \( 2020 \) obtained results suggesting the fraction of trees occurring in the test data isomorphic to trees in the training set accounts for a non-trivial variation in parser performance. similar to other statistical analyses in nlp , the results were based on evaluating linear regressions. however , the study had methodological issues and was undertaken using a small sample size leading to unreliable results. we present a replication study in which we also bin sentences by length and find that only a small subset of sentences vary in performance with respect to graph isomorphism. further , the correlation observed between parser performance and graph isomorphism in the wild disappears when controlling for covariants. however , in a controlled experiment , where covariants are kept fixed , we do observe a correlation. we suggest that conclusions drawn from statistical analyses like this need to be tempered and that controlled experiments can complement them by more readily teasing factors apart.
