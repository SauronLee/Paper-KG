TIMERS: Document-level Temporal Relation Extraction | Puneet Mathur | we present timers - a time , rhetorical and syntactic-aware model for document-level temporal relation classification in the english language. our proposed method leverages rhetorical discourse features and temporal arguments from semantic role labels , in addition to traditional local syntactic features , trained through a gated relational-gcn. extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms previous methods by 5-18% on the tddiscourse , timebank-dense , and matres datasets due to our discourse-level modeling.
