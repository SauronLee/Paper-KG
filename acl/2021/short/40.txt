ROPE: Reading Order Equivariant Positional Encoding for Graph-based Document Information Extraction | Chen-Yu Lee | natural reading orders of words are crucial for information extraction from form-like documents. despite recent advances in graph convolutional networks \( gcns \) on modeling spatial layout patterns of documents , they have limited ability to capture reading orders of given word-level node representations in a graph. we propose reading order equivariant positional encoding \( rope \) , a new positional encoding technique designed to apprehend the sequential presentation of words in documents. rope generates unique reading order codes for neighboring words relative to the target word given a word-level graph connectivity. we study two fundamental document entity extraction tasks including word labeling and word grouping on the public funsd dataset and a large-scale payment dataset. we show that rope consistently improves existing gcns with a margin up to 8.4% f1-score.
