Video Paragraph Captioning as a Text Summarization Task | Hui Liu | video paragraph captioning aims to generate a set of coherent sentences to describe a video that contains several events. most previous methods simplify this task by using ground-truth event segments. in this work , we propose a novel framework by taking this task as a text summarization task. we first generate lots of sentence-level captions focusing on different video clips and then summarize these captions to obtain the final paragraph caption. our method does not depend on ground-truth event segments. experiments on two popular datasets activitynet captions and youcookii demonstrate the advantages of our new framework. on the activitynet dataset , our method even outperforms some previous methods using ground-truth event segment labels.
