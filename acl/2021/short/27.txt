WikiSum: Coherent Summarization Dataset for Efficient Human-Evaluation | Nachshon Cohen | recent works made significant advances on summarization tasks , facilitated by summarization datasets. several existing datasets have the form of coherent-paragraph summaries. however , these datasets were curated from academic documents that were written for experts , thus making the essential step of assessing the summarization output through human-evaluation very demanding. to overcome these limitations , we present a dataset based on article summaries appearing on the wikihow website , composed of how-to articles and coherent-paragraph summaries written in plain language. we compare our dataset attributes to existing ones , including readability and world-knowledge , showing our dataset makes human evaluation significantly easier and thus , more effective. a human evaluation conducted on pubmed and the proposed dataset reinforces our findings.
