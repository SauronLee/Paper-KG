Improving Arabic Diacritization with Regularized Decoding and Adversarial Training | Han Qin | arabic diacritization is a fundamental task for arabic language processing. previous studies have demonstrated that automatically generated knowledge can be helpful to this task. however , these studies regard the auto-generated knowledge instances as gold references , which limits their effectiveness since such knowledge is not always accurate and inferior instances can lead to incorrect predictions. in this paper , we propose to use regularized decoding and adversarial training to appropriately learn from such noisy knowledge for diacritization. experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that , even with quite flawed auto-generated knowledge , our model can still learn adequate diacritics and outperform all previous studies , on both datasets.
