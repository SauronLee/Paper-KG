Three Sentences Are All You Need: Local Path Enhanced Document Relation Extraction | Quzhe Huang | document-level relation extraction \( re \) is a more challenging task than sentence re as it often requires reasoning over multiple sentences. yet , human annotators usually use a small number of sentences to identify the relationship between a given entity pair. in this paper , we present an embarrassingly simple but effective method to heuristically select evidence sentences for document-level re , which can be easily combined with bilstm to achieve good performance on benchmark datasets , even better than fancy graph neural network based methods. we have released our code at https://github.com/andrewzhe/three-sentences-are-all-you-need.
