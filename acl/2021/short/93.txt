Improving Lexically Constrained Neural Machine Translation with Source-Conditioned Masked Span Prediction | Gyubok Lee | accurate terminology translation is crucial for ensuring the practicality and reliability of neural machine translation \( nmt \) systems. to address this , lexically constrained nmt explores various methods to ensure pre-specified words and phrases appear in the translation output. however , in many cases , those methods are studied on general domain corpora , where the terms are mostly uni- and bi-grams \( >98% \) . in this paper , we instead tackle a more challenging setup consisting of domain-specific corpora with much longer n-gram and highly specialized terms. inspired by the recent success of masked span prediction models , we propose a simple and effective training strategy that achieves consistent improvements on both terminology and sentence-level translation for three domain-specific corpora in two language pairs.
