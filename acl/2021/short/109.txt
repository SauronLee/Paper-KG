Modeling Discriminative Representations for Out-of-Domain Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning | Zhiyuan Zeng | detecting out-of-domain \( ood \) or unknown intents from user queries is essential in a task-oriented dialog system. a key challenge of ood detection is to learn discriminative semantic features. traditional cross-entropy loss only focuses on whether a sample is correctly classified , and does not explicitly distinguish the margins between categories. in this paper , we propose a supervised contrastive learning objective to minimize intra-class variance by pulling together in-domain intents belonging to the same class and maximize inter-class variance by pushing apart samples from different classes. besides , we employ an adversarial augmentation mechanism to obtain pseudo diverse views of a sample in the latent space. experiments on two public datasets prove the effectiveness of our method capturing discriminative representations for ood detection.
