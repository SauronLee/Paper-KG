Counterfactuals to Control Latent Disentangled Text Representations for Style Transfer | Sharmila Reddy Nangi | disentanglement of latent representations into content and style spaces has been a commonly employed method for unsupervised text style transfer. these techniques aim to learn the disentangled representations and tweak them to modify the style of a sentence. in this paper , we propose a counterfactual-based method to modify the latent representation , by posing a ‘what-if’ scenario. this simple and disciplined approach also enables a fine-grained control on the transfer strength. we conduct experiments with the proposed methodology on multiple attribute transfer tasks like sentiment , formality and excitement to support our hypothesis.
