Unsupervised Pronoun Resolution via Masked Noun-Phrase Prediction | Ming Shen | in this work , we propose masked noun-phrase prediction \( mnpp \) , a pre-training strategy to tackle pronoun resolution in a fully unsupervised setting. firstly , we evaluate our pre-trained model on various pronoun resolution datasets without any finetuning. our method outperforms all previous unsupervised methods on all datasets by large margins. secondly , we proceed to a few-shot setting where we finetune our pre-trained model on winogrande-s and xs separately. our method outperforms roberta-large baseline with large margins , meanwhile , achieving a higher auc score after further finetuning on the remaining three official splits of winogrande.
