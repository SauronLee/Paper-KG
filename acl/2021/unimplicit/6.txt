A Mention-Based System for Revision Requirements Detection | Ahmed Ruby | exploring aspects of sentential meaning that are implicit or underspecified in context is important for sentence understanding. in this paper , we propose a novel architecture based on mentions for revision requirements detection. the goal is to improve understandability , addressing some types of revisions , especially for the replaced pronoun type. we show that our mention-based system can predict replaced pronouns well on the mention-level. however , our combined sentence-level system does not improve on the sentence-level bert baseline. we also present additional contrastive systems , and show results for each type of edit.
