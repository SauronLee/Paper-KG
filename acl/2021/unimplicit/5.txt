Human-Model Divergence in the Handling of Vagueness | Elias Stengel-Eskin | while aggregate performance metrics can generate valuable insights at a large scale , their dominance means more complex and nuanced language phenomena , such as vagueness , may be overlooked. focusing on vague terms \( e.g. sunny , cloudy , young , etc. \) we inspect the behavior of visually grounded and text-only models , finding systematic divergences from human judgments even when a modelâ€™s overall performance is high. to help explain this disparity , we identify two assumptions made by the datasets and models examined and , guided by the philosophy of vagueness , isolate cases where they do not hold.
