Let’s be explicit about that: Distant supervision for implicit discourse relation classification via connective prediction | Murathan Kurfalı | in implicit discourse relation classification , we want to predict the relation between adjacent sentences in the absence of any overt discourse connectives. this is challenging even for humans , leading to shortage of annotated data , a fact that makes the task even more difficult for supervised machine learning approaches. in the current study , we perform implicit discourse relation classification without relying on any labeled implicit relation. we sidestep the lack of data through explicitation of implicit relations to reduce the task to two sub-problems: language modeling and explicit discourse relation classification , a much easier problem. our experimental results show that this method can even marginally outperform the state-of-the-art , in spite of being much simpler than alternative models of comparable performance. moreover , we show that the achieved performance is robust across domains as suggested by the zero-shot experiments on a completely different domain. this indicates that recent advances in language modeling have made language models sufficiently good at capturing inter-sentence relations without the help of explicit discourse markers.
