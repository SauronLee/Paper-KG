Learn The Big Picture: Representation Learning for Clustering | Sumanta Kashyapi | existing supervised models for text clustering find it difficult to directly optimize for clustering results. this is because clustering is a discrete process and it is difficult to estimate meaningful gradient of any discrete function that can drive gradient based optimization algorithms. so , existing supervised clustering algorithms indirectly optimize for some continuous function that approximates the clustering process. we propose a scalable training strategy that directly optimizes for a discrete clustering metric. we train a bert-based embedding model using our method and evaluate it on two publicly available datasets. we show that our method outperforms another bert-based embedding model employing triplet loss and other unsupervised baselines. this suggests that optimizing directly for the clustering outcome indeed yields better representations suitable for clustering.
