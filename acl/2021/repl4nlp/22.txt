Bayesian Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning with Matrix-Valued Kernels for Quality Estimation | Abiola Obamuyide | most current quality estimation \( qe \) models for machine translation are trained and evaluated in a fully supervised setting requiring significant quantities of labelled training data. however , obtaining labelled data can be both expensive and time-consuming. in addition , the test data that a deployed qe model would be exposed to may differ from its training data in significant ways. in particular , training samples are often labelled by one or a small set of annotators , whose perceptions of translation quality and needs may differ substantially from those of end-users , who will employ predictions in practice. thus , it is desirable to be able to adapt qe models efficiently to new user data with limited supervision data. to address these challenges , we propose a bayesian meta-learning approach for adapting qe models to the needs and preferences of each user with limited supervision. to enhance performance , we further propose an extension to a state-of-the-art bayesian meta-learning approach which utilizes a matrix-valued kernel for bayesian meta-learning of quality estimation. experiments on data with varying number of users and language characteristics demonstrates that the proposed bayesian meta-learning approach delivers improved predictive performance in both limited and full supervision settings.
