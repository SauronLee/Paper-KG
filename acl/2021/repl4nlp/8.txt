Text Style Transfer: Leveraging a Style Classifier on Entangled Latent Representations | Xiaoyan Li | learning a good latent representation is essential for text style transfer , which generates a new sentence by changing the attributes of a given sentence while preserving its content. most previous works adopt disentangled latent representation learning to realize style transfer. we propose a novel text style transfer algorithm with entangled latent representation , and introduce a style classifier that can regulate the latent structure and transfer style. moreover , our algorithm for style transfer applies to both single-attribute and multi-attribute transfer. extensive experimental results show that our method generally outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
