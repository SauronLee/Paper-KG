Knodle: Modular Weakly Supervised Learning with PyTorch | Anastasiia Sedova | strategies for improving the training and prediction quality of weakly supervised machine learning models vary in how much they are tailored to a specific task or integrated with a specific model architecture. in this work , we introduce knodle , a software framework that treats weak data annotations , deep learning models , and methods for improving weakly supervised training as separate , modular components. this modularization gives the training process access to fine-grained information such as data set characteristics , matches of heuristic rules , or elements of the deep learning model ultimately used for prediction. hence , our framework can encompass a wide range of training methods for improving weak supervision , ranging from methods that only look at correlations of rules and output classes \( independently of the machine learning model trained with the resulting labels \) , to those that harness the interplay of neural networks and weakly labeled data. we illustrate the benchmarking potential of the framework with a performance comparison of several reference implementations on a selection of datasets that are already available in knodle.
