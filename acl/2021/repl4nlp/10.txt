Revisiting Pretraining with Adapters | Seungwon Kim | pretrained language models have served as the backbone for many state-of-the-art nlp results. these models are large and expensive to train. recent work suggests that continued pretraining on task-specific data is worth the effort as pretraining leads to improved performance on downstream tasks. we explore alternatives to full-scale task-specific pretraining of language models through the use of adapter modules , a parameter-efficient approach to transfer learning. we find that adapter-based pretraining is able to achieve comparable results to task-specific pretraining while using a fraction of the overall trainable parameters. we further explore direct use of adapters without pretraining and find that the direct fine-tuning performs mostly on par with pretrained adapter models , contradicting previously proposed benefits of continual pretraining in full pretraining fine-tuning strategies. lastly , we perform an ablation study on task-adaptive pretraining to investigate how different hyperparameter settings can change the effectiveness of the pretraining.
