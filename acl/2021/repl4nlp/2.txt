Comprehension Based Question Answering using Bloom’s Taxonomy | Pritish Sahu | current pre-trained language models have lots of knowledge , but a more limited ability to use that knowledge. bloom’s taxonomy helps educators teach children how to use knowledge by categorizing comprehension skills , so we use it to analyze and improve the comprehension skills of large pre-trained language models. our experiments focus on zero-shot question answering , using the taxonomy to provide proximal context that helps the model answer questions by being relevant to those questions. we show targeting context in this manner improves performance across 4 popular common sense question answer datasets.
