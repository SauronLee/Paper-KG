Temporal-aware Language Representation Learning From Crowdsourced Labels | Yang Hao | learning effective language representations from crowdsourced labels is crucial for many real-world machine learning tasks. a challenging aspect of this problem is that the quality of crowdsourced labels suffer high intra- and inter-observer variability. since the high-capacity deep neural networks can easily memorize all disagreements among crowdsourced labels , directly applying existing supervised language representation learning algorithms may yield suboptimal solutions. in this paper , we propose
