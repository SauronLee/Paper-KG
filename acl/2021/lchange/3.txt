Linguistic change and historical periodization of Old Literary Finnish | Niko Partanen | in this study , we have normalized and lemmatized an old literary finnish corpus using a lemmatization model trained on texts from agricola. we analyse the error types that occur and appear in different decades , and use word error rate \( wer \) and different error types as a proxy for measuring linguistic innovation and change. we show that the proposed approach works , and the errors are connected to accumulating changes and innovations , which also results in a continuous decrease in the accuracy of the model. the described error types also guide further work in improving these models , and document the currently observed issues. we also have trained word embeddings for four centuries of lemmatized old literary finnish , which are available on zenodo.
