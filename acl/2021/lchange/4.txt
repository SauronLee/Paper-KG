A diachronic evaluation of gender asymmetry in euphemism | Anna Kapron-King | the use of euphemisms is a known driver of language change. it has been proposed that women use euphemisms more than men. although there have been several studies investigating gender differences in language , the claim about euphemism usage has not been tested comprehensively through time. if women do use euphemisms more , this could mean that women also lead the formation of new euphemisms and language change over time. using four large diachronic text corpora of english , we evaluate the claim that women use euphemisms more than men through a quantitative analysis. we assembled a list of 106 euphemism-taboo pairs to analyze their relative use through time by each gender in the corpora. contrary to the existing belief , our results show that women do not use euphemisms with a higher proportion than men. we repeated the analysis using different subsets of the euphemism-taboo pairs list and found that our result was robust. our study indicates that in a broad range of settings involving both speech and writing , and with varying degrees of formality , women do not use or form euphemisms more than men.
