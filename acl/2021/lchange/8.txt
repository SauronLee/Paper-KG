Tracking Semantic Change in Cognate Sets for English and Romance Languages | Ana Sabina Uban | semantic divergence in related languages is a key concern of historical linguistics. we cross-linguistically investigate the semantic divergence of cognate pairs in english and romance languages , by means of word embeddings. to this end , we introduce a new curated dataset of cognates in all pairs of those languages. we describe the types of errors that occurred during the automated cognate identification process and manually correct them. additionally , we label the english cognates according to their etymology , separating them into two groups: old borrowings and recent borrowings. on this curated dataset , we analyse word properties such as frequency and polysemy , and the distribution of similarity scores between cognate sets in different languages. we automatically identify different clusters of english cognates , setting a new direction of research in cognates , borrowings and possibly false friends analysis in related languages.
