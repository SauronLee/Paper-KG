Proof Net Structure for Neural Lambek Categorial Parsing | Aditya Bhargava | in this paper , we present the first statistical parser for lambek categorial grammar \( lcg \) , a grammatical formalism for which the graphical proof method known as *proof nets* is applicable. our parser incorporates proof net structure and constraints into a system based on self-attention networks via novel model elements. our experiments on an english lcg corpus show that incorporating term graph structure is helpful to the model , improving both parsing accuracy and coverage. moreover , we derive novel loss functions by expressing proof net constraints as differentiable functions of our model output , enabling us to train our parser without ground-truth derivations.
