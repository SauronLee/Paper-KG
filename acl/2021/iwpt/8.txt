Multilingual Dependency Parsing for Low-Resource African Languages: Case Studies on Bambara, Wolof, and Yoruba | Cheikh M. Bamba Dione | this paper describes a methodology for syntactic knowledge transfer between high-resource languages to extremely low-resource languages. the methodology consists in leveraging multilingual bert self-attention model pretrained on large datasets to develop a multilingual multi-task model that can predict universal dependencies annotations for three african low-resource languages. the ud annotations include universal part-of-speech , morphological features , lemmas , and dependency trees. in our experiments , we used multilingual word embeddings and a total of 11 universal dependencies treebanks drawn from three high-resource languages \( english , french , norwegian \) and three low-resource languages \( bambara , wolof and yoruba \) . we developed various models to test specific language combinations involving contemporary contact languages or genetically related languages. the results of the experiments show that multilingual models that involve high-resource languages and low-resource languages with contemporary contact between each other can provide better results than combinations that only include unrelated languages. as far genetic relationships are concerned , we could not draw any conclusion regarding the impact of language combinations involving the selected low-resource languages , namely wolof and yoruba.
