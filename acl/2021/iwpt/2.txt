The Reading Machine: A Versatile Framework for Studying Incremental Parsing Strategies | Franck Dary | the reading machine , is a parsing framework that takes as input raw text and performs six standard nlp tasks: tokenization , pos tagging , morphological analysis , lemmatization , dependency parsing and sentence segmentation. it is built upon transition based parsing , and allows to implement a large number of parsing configurations , among which a fully incremental one. three case studies are presented to highlight the versatility of the framework. the first one explores whether an incremental parser is able to take into account top-down dependencies \( i.e. the influence of high level decisions on low level ones \) , the second compares the performances of an incremental and a pipe-line architecture and the third quantifies the impact of the right context on the predictions made by an incremental parser.
