Incorporating Compositionality and Morphology into End-to-End Models | Emily Pitler | many neural end-to-end systems today do not rely on syntactic parse trees , as much of the information that parse trees provide is encoded in the parameters of pretrained models. lessons learned from parsing technologies and from taking a multilingual perspective , however , are still relevant even for end-to-end models. this talk will describe work that relies on compositionality in semantic parsing and in reading comprehension requiring numerical reasoning. weâ€™ll then describe a new dataset that requires advances in multilingual modeling , and some approaches designed to better model morphology than off-the-shelf subword models that make some progress on these challenges.
