End-to-end mBERT based Seq2seq Enhanced Dependency Parser with Linguistic Typology knowledge | Chinmay Choudhary | we describe the nuig solution for iwpt 2021 shared task of enhanced dependency \( ed \) parsing in multiple languages. for this shared task , we propose and evaluate an end-to-end seq2seq mbert-based ed parser which predicts the ed-parse tree of a given input sentence as a relative head-position tag-sequence. our proposed model is a multitasking neural-network which performs five key tasks simultaneously namely upos tagging , ufeat tagging , lemmatization , dependency-parsing and ed-parsing. furthermore we utilise the linguistic typology available in the wals database to improve the ability of our proposed end-to-end parser to transfer across languages. results show that our proposed seq2seq ed-parser performs on par with state-of-the-art ed-parser despite having a much simpler de- sign.
