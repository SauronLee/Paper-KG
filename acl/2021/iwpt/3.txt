Semi-Automatic Construction of Text-to-SQL Data for Domain Transfer | Tianyi Li | strong and affordable in-domain data is a desirable asset when transferring trained semantic parsers to novel domains. as previous methods for semi-automatically constructing such data cannot handle the complexity of realistic sql queries , we propose to construct sql queries via context-dependent sampling , and introduce the concept of topic. along with our sql query construction method , we propose a novel pipeline of semi-automatic text-to-sql dataset construction that covers the broad space of sql queries. we show that the created dataset is comparable with expert annotation along multiple dimensions , and is capable of improving domain transfer performance for sota semantic parsers.
