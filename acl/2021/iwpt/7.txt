A Falta de Pan, Buenas Son Tortas: The Efficacy of Predicted UPOS Tags for Low Resource UD Parsing | Mark Anderson | we evaluate the efficacy of predicted upos tags as input features for dependency parsers in lower resource settings to evaluate how treebank size affects the impact tagging accuracy has on parsing performance. we do this for real low resource universal dependency treebanks , artificially low resource data with varying treebank sizes , and for very small treebanks with varying amounts of augmented data. we find that predicted upos tags are somewhat helpful for low resource treebanks , especially when fewer fully-annotated trees are available. we also find that this positive impact diminishes as the amount of data increases.
