Bidirectional Domain Adaptation Using Weighted Multi-Task Learning | Daniel Dakota | domain adaption in syntactic parsing is still a significant challenge. we address the issue of data imbalance between the in-domain and out-of-domain treebank typically used for the problem. we define domain adaptation as a multi-task learning \( mtl \) problem , which allows us to train two parsers , one for each do-main. our results show that the mtl approach is beneficial for the smaller treebank. for the larger treebank , we need to use loss weighting in order to avoid a decrease in performance be-low the single task. in order to determine towhat degree the data imbalance between two domains and the domain differences affect results , we also carry out an experiment with two imbalanced in-domain treebanks and show that loss weighting also improves performance in an in-domain setting. given loss weighting in mtl , we can improve results for both parsers.
