Generic Oracles for Structured Prediction | Christoph Teichmann | when learned without exploration , local models for structured prediction tasks are subject to exposure bias and cannot be trained without detailed guidance. active imitation learning \( ail \) , also known in nlp as dynamic oracle learning , is a general technique for working around these issues by allowing the exploration of different outputs at training time. ail requires oracle feedback: an oracle is any algorithm which can , given a partial candidate solution and gold annotation , find the correct \( minimum loss \) next output to produce. this paper describes a general finite state technique for deriving oracles. the technique describe is also efficient and will greatly expand the tasks for which ail can be used.
