A Proposal: Interactively Learning to Summarise Timelines by Reinforcement Learning | Yuxuan Ye | timeline summarisation \( tls \) aims to generate a concise , time-ordered list of events described in sources such as news articles. however , current systems do not provide an adequate way to adapt to new domains nor to focus on the aspects of interest to a particular user. therefore , we propose a method for interactively learning abstractive tls using reinforcement learning \( rl \) . we define a compound reward function and use rl to fine-tune an abstractive multi-document summarisation \( mds \) model , which avoids the need to train using reference summaries. one of the sub-reward functions will be learned interactively from user feedback to ensure the consistency between usersâ€™ demands and the generated timeline. the other sub-reward functions contribute to topical coherence and linguistic fluency. we plan experiments to evaluate whether our approach could generate accurate and precise timelines tailored for each user.
