Dynamic Facet Selection by Maximizing Graded Relevance | Michael Glass | dynamic faceted search \( dfs \) , an interactive query refinement technique , is a form of humanâ€“computer information retrieval \( hcir \) approach. it allows users to narrow down search results through facets , where the facets-documents mapping is determined at runtime based on the context of user query instead of pre-indexing the facets statically. in this paper , we propose a new unsupervised approach for dynamic facet generation , namely optimistic facets , which attempts to generate the best possible subset of facets , hence maximizing expected discounted cumulative gain \( dcg \) , a measure of ranking quality that uses a graded relevance scale. we also release code to generate a new evaluation dataset. through empirical results on two datasets , we show that the proposed dfs approach considerably improves the document ranking in the search results.
