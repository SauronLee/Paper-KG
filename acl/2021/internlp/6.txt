Tackling Fake News Detection by Interactively Learning Representations using Graph Neural Networks | Nikhil Mehta | easy access , variety of content , and fast widespread interactions are some of the reasons that have made social media increasingly popular in todayâ€™s society. however , this has also enabled the widespread propagation of fake news , text that is published with an intent to spread misinformation and sway beliefs. detecting fake news is important to prevent misinformation and maintain a healthy society. while prior works have tackled this problem by building supervised learning systems , automatedly modeling the social media landscape that enables the spread of fake news is challenging. on the contrary , having humans fact check all news is not scalable. thus , in this paper , we propose to approach this problem
