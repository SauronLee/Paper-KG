SHAPELURN: An Interactive Language Learning Game with Logical Inference | Katharina Stein | we investigate if a model can learn natural language with minimal linguistic input through interaction. addressing this question , we design and implement an interactive language learning game that learns logical semantic representations compositionally. our game allows us to explore the benefits of logical inference for natural language learning. evaluation shows that the model can accurately narrow down potential logical representations for words over the course of the game , suggesting that our model is able to learn lexical mappings from scratch successfully.
