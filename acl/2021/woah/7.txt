MIN_PT: An European Portuguese Lexicon for Minorities Related Terms | Paula Fortuna | hate speech-related lexicons have been proved to be useful for many tasks such as data collection and classification. however , existing portuguese lexicons do not distinguish between european and brazilian portuguese , and do not include neutral terms that are potentially useful to detect a broader spectrum of content referring to minorities. in this work , we present min_pt , a new european portuguese lexicon for minorities-related terms specifically designed to tackle the limitations of existing resources. we describe the data collection and annotation process , discuss the limitation and ethical concerns , and prove the utility of the resource by applying it to a use case for the portuguese 2021 presidential elections.
