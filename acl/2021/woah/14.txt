Context Sensitivity Estimation in Toxicity Detection | Alexandros Xenos | user posts whose perceived toxicity depends on the conversational context are rare in current toxicity detection datasets. hence , toxicity detectors trained on current datasets will also disregard context , making the detection of context-sensitive toxicity a lot harder when it occurs. we constructed and publicly release a dataset of 10k posts with two kinds of toxicity labels per post , obtained from annotators who considered \( i \) both the current post and the previous one as context , or \( ii \) only the current post. we introduce a new task , context-sensitivity estimation , which aims to identify posts whose perceived toxicity changes if the context \( previous post \) is also considered. using the new dataset , we show that systems can be developed for this task. such systems could be used to enhance toxicity detection datasets with more context-dependent posts or to suggest when moderators should consider the parent posts , which may not always be necessary and may introduce additional costs.
