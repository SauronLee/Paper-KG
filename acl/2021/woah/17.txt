When the Echo Chamber Shatters: Examining the Use of Community-Specific Language Post-Subreddit Ban | Milo Trujillo | community-level bans are a common tool against groups that enable online harassment and harmful speech. unfortunately , the efficacy of community bans has only been partially studied and with mixed results. here , we provide a flexible unsupervised methodology to identify in-group language and track user activity on reddit both before and after the ban of a community \( subreddit \) . we use a simple word frequency divergence to identify uncommon words overrepresented in a given community , not as a proxy for harmful speech but as a linguistic signature of the community. we apply our method to 15 banned subreddits , and find that community response is heterogeneous between subreddits and between users of a subreddit. top users were more likely to become less active overall , while random users often reduced use of in-group language without decreasing activity. finally , we find some evidence that the effectiveness of bans aligns with the content of a community. users of dark humor communities were largely unaffected by bans while users of communities organized around white supremacy and fascism were the most affected. altogether , our results show that bans do not affect all groups or users equally , and pave the way to understanding the effect of bans across communities.
