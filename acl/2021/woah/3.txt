Memes in the Wild: Assessing the Generalizability of the Hateful Memes Challenge Dataset | Hannah Kirk | hateful memes pose a unique challenge for current machine learning systems because their message is derived from both text- and visual-modalities. to this effect , facebook released the hateful memes challenge , a dataset of memes with pre-extracted text captions , but it is unclear whether these synthetic examples generalize to ‘memes in the wild’. in this paper , we collect hateful and non-hateful memes from pinterest to evaluate out-of-sample performance on models pre-trained on the facebook dataset. we find that ‘memes in the wild’ differ in two key aspects: 1 \) captions must be extracted via ocr , injecting noise and diminishing performance of multimodal models , and 2 \) memes are more diverse than ‘traditional memes’ , including screenshots of conversations or text on a plain background. this paper thus serves as a reality-check for the current benchmark of hateful meme detection and its applicability for detecting real world hate.
