Targets and Aspects in Social Media Hate Speech | Alexander Shvets | mainstream research on hate speech focused so far predominantly on the task of classifying mainly social media posts with respect to predefined typologies of rather coarse-grained hate speech categories. this may be sufficient if the goal is to detect and delete abusive language posts. however , removal is not always possible due to the legislation of a country. also , there is evidence that hate speech cannot be successfully combated by merely removing hate speech posts; they should be countered by education and counter-narratives. for this purpose , we need to identify \( i \) who is the target in a given hate speech post , and \( ii \) what aspects \( or characteristics \) of the target are attributed to the target in the post. as the first approximation , we propose to adapt a generic state-of-the-art concept extraction model to the hate speech domain. the outcome of the experiments is promising and can serve as inspiration for further work on the task
