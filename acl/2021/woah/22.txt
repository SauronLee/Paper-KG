Racist or Sexist Meme? Classifying Memes beyond Hateful | Haris Bin Zia | memes are the combinations of text and images that are often humorous in nature. but , that may not always be the case , and certain combinations of texts and images may depict hate , referred to as hateful memes. this work presents a multimodal pipeline that takes both visual and textual features from memes into account to \( 1 \) identify the protected category \( e.g. race , sex etc. \) that has been attacked; and \( 2 \) detect the type of attack \( e.g. contempt , slurs etc. \) . our pipeline uses state-of-the-art pre-trained visual and textual representations , followed by a simple logistic regression classifier. we employ our pipeline on the hateful memes challenge dataset with additional newly created fine-grained labels for protected category and type of attack. our best model achieves an auroc of 0.96 for identifying the protected category , and 0.97 for detecting the type of attack. we release our code at https://github.com/harisbinzia/hatefulmemes
