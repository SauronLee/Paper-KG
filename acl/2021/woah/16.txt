Data Integration for Toxic Comment Classification: Making More Than 40 Datasets Easily Accessible in One Unified Format | Julian Risch | with the rise of research on toxic comment classification , more and more annotated datasets have been released. the wide variety of the task \( different languages , different labeling processes and schemes \) has led to a large amount of heterogeneous datasets that can be used for training and testing very specific settings. despite recent efforts to create web pages that provide an overview , most publications still use only a single dataset. they are not stored in one central database , they come in many different data formats and it is difficult to interpret their class labels and how to reuse these labels in other projects. to overcome these issues , we present a collection of more than thirty datasets in the form of a software tool that automatizes downloading and processing of the data and presents them in a unified data format that also offers a mapping of compatible class labels. another advantage of that tool is that it gives an overview of properties of available datasets , such as different languages , platforms , and class labels to make it easier to select suitable training and test data.
