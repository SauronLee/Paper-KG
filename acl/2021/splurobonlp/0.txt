Symbol Grounding and Task Learning from Imperfect Corrections | Mattias Appelgren | this paper describes a method for learning from a teacher’s potentially unreliable corrective feedback in an interactive task learning setting. the graphical model uses discourse coherence to jointly learn symbol grounding , domain concepts and valid plans. our experiments show that the agent learns its domain-level task in spite of the teacher’s mistakes.
