Visually Grounded Follow-up Questions: a Dataset of Spatial Questions Which Require Dialogue History | Tianai Dong | in this paper , we define and evaluate a methodology for extracting history-dependent spatial questions from visual dialogues. we say that a question is history-dependent if it requires \( parts of \) its dialogue history to be interpreted. we argue that some kinds of visual questions define a context upon which a follow-up spatial question relies. we call the question that restricts the context: trigger , and we call the spatial question that requires the trigger question to be answered: zoomer. we automatically extract different trigger and zoomer pairs based on the visual property that the questions rely on \( e.g. color , number \) . we manually annotate the automatically extracted trigger and zoomer pairs to verify which zoomers require their trigger. we implement a simple baseline architecture based on a sota multimodal encoder. our results reveal that there is much room for improvement for answering history-dependent questions.
