Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Table Balancing Robot | Haein Jeon | with the development of robotics , the use of robots in daily life is increasing , which has led to the need for anyone to easily train robots to improve robot use. interactive reinforcement learning \( iarl \) is a method for robot training based on humanâ€“robot interaction; prior studies on iarl provide only limited types of feedback or require appropriately designed shaping rewards , which is known to be difficult and time-consuming. therefore , in this study , we propose interactive deep reinforcement learning models based on voice feedback. in the proposed system , a robot learns the task of cooperative table balancing through deep q-network using voice feedback provided by humans in real-time , with automatic speech recognition \( asr \) and sentiment analysis to understand human voice feedback. as a result , an optimal policy convergence rate of up to 96% was realized , and performance was improved in all voice feedback-based models
