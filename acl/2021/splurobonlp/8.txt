Multi-Level Gazetteer-Free Geocoding | Sayali Kulkarni | we present a multi-level geocoding model \( mlg \) that learns to associate texts to geographic coordinates. the earth’s surface is represented using space-filling curves that decompose the sphere into a hierarchical grid. mlg balances classification granularity and accuracy by combining losses across multiple levels and jointly predicting cells at different levels simultaneously. it obtains large gains without any gazetteer metadata , demonstrating that it can effectively learn the connection between text spans and coordinates—and thus makes it a gazetteer-free geocoder. furthermore , mlg obtains state-of-the-art results for toponym resolution on three english datasets without any dataset-specific tuning.
