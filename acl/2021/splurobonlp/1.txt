Learning to Read Maps: Understanding Natural Language Instructions from Unseen Maps | Miltiadis Marios Katsakioris | robust situated dialog requires the ability to process instructions based on spatial information , which may or may not be available. we propose a model , based on lxmert , that can extract spatial information from text instructions and attend to landmarks on openstreetmap \( osm \) referred to in a natural language instruction. whilst , osm is a valuable resource , as with any open-sourced data , there is noise and variation in the names referred to on the map , as well as , variation in natural language instructions , hence the need for data-driven methods over rule-based systems. this paper demonstrates that the gold gps location can be accurately predicted from the natural language instruction and metadata with 72% accuracy for previously seen maps and 64% for unseen maps.
