Modeling Semantics and Pragmatics of Spatial Prepositions via Hierarchical Common-Sense Primitives | Georgiy Platonov | understanding spatial expressions and using them appropriately is necessary for seamless and natural human-machine interaction. however , capturing the semantics and appropriate usage of spatial prepositions is notoriously difficult , because of their vagueness and polysemy. although modern data-driven approaches are good at capturing statistical regularities in the usage , they usually require substantial sample sizes , often do not generalize well to unseen instances and , most importantly , their structure is essentially opaque to analysis , which makes diagnosing problems and understanding their reasoning process difficult. in this work , we discuss our attempt at modeling spatial senses of prepositions in english using a combination of rule-based and statistical learning approaches. each preposition model is implemented as a tree where each node computes certain intuitive relations associated with the preposition , with the root computing the final value of the prepositional relation itself. the models operate on a set of artificial 3d “room world” environments , designed in blender , taking the scene itself as an input. we also discuss our annotation framework used to collect human judgments employed in the model training. both our factored models and black-box baseline models perform quite well , but the factored models will enable reasoned explanations of spatial relation judgements.
