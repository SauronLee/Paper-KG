Plan Explanations that Exploit a Cognitive Spatial Model | Raj Korpan | ideally , people who navigate together in a complex indoor space share a mental model that facilitates explanation. this paper reports on a robot control system whose cognitive world model is based on spatial affordances that generalize over its perceptual data. given a target , the control system formulates multiple plans , each with a model-relevant metric , and selects among them. as a result , it can provide readily understandable natural language about the robot’s intentions and confidence , and generate diverse , contrastive explanations that reference the acquired spatial model. empirical results in large , complex environments demonstrate the robot’s ability to provide human-friendly explanations in natural language.
