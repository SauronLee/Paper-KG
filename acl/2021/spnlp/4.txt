Mode recovery in neural autoregressive sequence modeling | Ilia Kulikov | despite its wide use , recent studies have revealed unexpected and undesirable properties of neural autoregressive sequence models trained with maximum likelihood , such as an unreasonably high affinity to short sequences after training and to infinitely long sequences at decoding time. we propose to study these phenomena by investigating how the modes , or local maxima , of a distribution are maintained throughout the full
