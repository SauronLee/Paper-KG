SmBoP: Semi-autoregressive Bottom-up Semantic Parsing | Ohad Rubin | the de-facto standard decoding method for semantic parsing in recent years has been to autoregressively decode the abstract syntax tree of the target program using a top-down depth-first traversal. in this work , we propose an alternative approach: a semi-autoregressive bottom-up parser \( smbop \) that constructs at decoding step t the top-k sub-trees of height â‰¤ t. our parser enjoys several benefits compared to top-down autoregressive parsing. from an efficiency perspective , bottom-up parsing allows to decode all sub-trees of a certain height in parallel , leading to logarithmic runtime complexity rather than linear. from a modeling perspective , a bottom-up parser learns representations for meaningful semantic sub-programs at each step , rather than for semantically-vacuous partial trees. we apply smbop on spider , a challenging zero-shot semantic parsing benchmark , and show that smbop leads to a 2.2x speed-up in decoding time and a ~5x speed-up in training time , compared to a semantic parser that uses autoregressive decoding. smbop obtains 71.1 denotation accuracy on spider , establishing a new state-of-the-art , and 69.5 exact match , comparable to the 69.6 exact match of the autoregressive rat-sql+grappa.
