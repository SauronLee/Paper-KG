A Globally Normalized Neural Model for Semantic Parsing | Chenyang Huang | in this paper , we propose a globally normalized model for context-free grammar \( cfg \) -based semantic parsing. instead of predicting a probability , our model predicts a real-valued score at each step and does not suffer from the label bias problem. experiments show that our approach outperforms locally normalized models on small datasets , but it does not yield improvement on a large dataset.
