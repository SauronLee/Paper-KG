Learning compositional structures for semantic graph parsing | Jonas Groschwitz | am dependency parsing is a method for neural semantic graph parsing that exploits the principle of compositionality. while am dependency parsers have been shown to be fast and accurate across several graphbanks , they require explicit annotations of the compositional tree structures for training. in the past , these were obtained using complex graphbank-specific heuristics written by experts. here we show how they can instead be trained directly on the graphs with a neural latent-variable model , drastically reducing the amount and complexity of manual heuristics. we demonstrate that our model picks up on several linguistic phenomena on its own and achieves comparable accuracy to supervised training , greatly facilitating the use of am dependency parsing for new sembanks.
