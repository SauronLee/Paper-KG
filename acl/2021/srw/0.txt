Investigation on Data Adaptation Techniques for Neural Named Entity Recognition | Evgeniia Tokarchuk | data processing is an important step in various natural language processing tasks. as the commonly used datasets in named entity recognition contain only a limited number of samples , it is important to obtain additional labeled data in an efficient and reliable manner. a common practice is to utilize large monolingual unlabeled corpora. another popular technique is to create synthetic data from the original labeled data \( data augmentation \) . in this work , we investigate the impact of these two methods on the performance of three different named entity recognition tasks.
