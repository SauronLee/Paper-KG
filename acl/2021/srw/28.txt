Predicting pragmatic discourse features in the language of adults with autism spectrum disorder | Christine Yang | individuals with autism spectrum disorder \( asd \) experience difficulties in social aspects of communication , but the linguistic characteristics associated with deficits in discourse and pragmatic expression are often difficult to precisely identify and quantify. we are currently collecting a corpus of transcribed natural conversations produced in an experimental setting in which participants with and without asd complete a number of collaborative tasks with their neurotypical peers. using this dyadic conversational data , we investigate three pragmatic features – politeness , uncertainty , and informativeness – and present a dataset of utterances annotated for each of these features on a three-point scale. we then introduce ongoing work in developing and training neural models to automatically predict these features , with the goal of identifying the same between-groups differences that are observed using manual annotations. we find the best performing model for all three features is a feed-forward neural network trained with bert embeddings. our models yield higher accuracy than ones used in previous approaches for deriving these features , with f1 exceeding 0.82 for all three pragmatic features.
