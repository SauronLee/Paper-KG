Situation-Based Multiparticipant Chat Summarization: a Concept, an Exploration-Annotation Tool and an Example Collection | Anna Smirnova | currently , text chatting is one of the primary means of communication. however , modern text chat still in general does not offer any navigation or even full-featured search , although the high volumes of messages demand it. in order to mitigate these inconveniences , we formulate the problem of situation-based summarization and propose a special data annotation tool intended for developing training and gold-standard data. a situation is a subset of messages revolving around a single event in both temporal and contextual senses: e.g , a group of friends arranging a meeting in chat , agreeing on date , time , and place. situations can be extracted via information retrieval , natural language processing , and machine learning techniques. since the task is novel , neither training nor gold-standard datasets for it have been created yet. in this paper , we present the formulation of the situation-based summarization problem. next , we describe chat corpora annotator \( cca \) : the first annotation system designed specifically for exploring and annotating chat log data. we also introduce a custom query language for semi-automatic situation extraction. finally , we present the first gold-standard dataset for situation-based summarization. the software source code and the dataset are publicly available.
