SumPubMed: Summarization Dataset of PubMed Scientific Articles | Vivek Gupta | most earlier work on text summarization is carried out on news article datasets. the summary in these datasets is naturally located at the beginning of the text. hence , a model can spuriously utilize this correlation for summary generation instead of truly learning to summarize. to address this issue , we constructed a new dataset , sumpubmed , using scientific articles from the pubmed archive. we conducted a human analysis of summary coverage , redundancy , readability , coherence , and informativeness on sumpubmed . sumpubmed is challenging because \( a \) the summary is distributed throughout the text \( not-localized on top \) , and \( b \) it contains rare domain-specific scientific terms. we observe that seq2seq models that adequately summarize news articles struggle to summarize sumpubmed . thus , sumpubmed opens new avenues for the future improvement of models as well as the development of new evaluation metrics.
