Zero Pronouns Identification based on Span prediction | Sei Iwata | the presence of zero-pronoun \( zp \) greatly affects the downstream tasks of nlp in pro-drop languages such as japanese and chinese. to tackle the problem , the previous works identified zps as sequence labeling on the word sequence or the linearlized tree nodes of the input. we propose a novel approach to zp identification by casting it as a query-based argument span prediction task. given a predicate as a query , our model predicts the omission with zp. in the experiments , our model surpassed the sequence labeling baseline.
