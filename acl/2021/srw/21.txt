Tools Impact on the Quality of Annotations for Chat Untangling | Jhonny Cerezo | the quality of the annotated data directly influences in the success of supervised nlp models. however , creating annotated datasets is often time-consuming and expensive. although the annotation tool takes an important role , we know little about how it influences annotation quality. we compare the quality of annotations for the task of chat-untangling made by non-experts annotators using two different tools. the first is slate , an existing command-line based tool , and the second is parlay , a new tool we developed that integrates mouse interaction and visual links. our experimental results indicate that , while both tools perform similarly in terms of annotation quality , parlay offers a significantly better user experience.
