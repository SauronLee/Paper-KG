Cross-lingual Evidence Improves Monolingual Fake News Detection | Daryna Dementieva | misleading information spreads on the internet at an incredible speed , which can lead to irreparable consequences in some cases. therefore , it is becoming essential to develop fake news detection technologies. while substantial work has been done in this direction , one of the limitations of the current approaches is that these models are focused only on one language and do not use multilingual information. in this work , we propose a new technique based on cross-lingual evidence \( ce \) that can be used for fake news detection and improve existing approaches. the hypothesis of the usage of cross-lingual evidence as a feature for fake news detection is confirmed , firstly , by manual experiment based on a set of known true and fake news. besides , we compared our fake news classification system based on the proposed feature with several strong baselines on two multi-domain datasets of general-topic news and one newly fake covid-19 news dataset showing that combining cross-lingual evidence with strong baselines such as roberta yields significant improvements in fake news detection.
