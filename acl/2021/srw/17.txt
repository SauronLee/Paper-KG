Joint Detection and Coreference Resolution of Entities and Events with Document-level Context Aggregation | Samuel Kriman | constructing knowledge graphs from unstructured text is an important task that is relevant to many domains. most previous work focuses on extracting information from sentences or paragraphs , due to the difficulty of analyzing longer contexts. in this paper we propose a new jointly trained model that can be used for various information extraction tasks at the document level. the tasks performed by this system are entity and event identification , typing , and coreference resolution. in order to improve entity and event typing , we utilize context-aware representations aggregated from the detected mentions of the corresponding entities and events across the entire document. by extending our system to document-level , we can improve our results by incorporating cross-sentence dependencies and additional contextual information that might not be available at the sentence level , which allows for more globally optimized predictions. we evaluate our system on documents from the ace05-e+ dataset and find significant improvement over the sentence-level sota on entity and event trigger identification and classification.
