Observing the Learning Curve of NMT Systems With Regard to Linguistic Phenomena | Patrick Stadler | in this paper we present our observations and evaluations by observing the linguistic performance of the system on several steps on the training process of various english-to-german neural machine translation models. the linguistic performance is measured through a semi-automatic process using a test suite. among several linguistic observations , we find that the translation quality of some linguistic categories decreased within the recorded iterations. additionally , we notice some drops of the translation quality of certain categories when using a larger corpus.
