Event-Centric Natural Language Processing | Muhao Chen | this tutorial targets researchers and practitioners who are interested in ai technologies that help machines understand natural language text , particularly real-world events described in the text. these include methods to extract the internal structures of an event regarding its protagonist \( s \) , participant \( s \) and properties , as well as external structures concerning memberships , temporal and causal relations of multiple events. this tutorial will provide audience with a systematic introduction of \( i \) knowledge representations of events , \( ii \) various methods for automated extraction , conceptualization and prediction of events and their relations , \( iii \) induction of event processes and properties , and \( iv \) a wide range of nlu and commonsense understanding tasks that benefit from aforementioned techniques. we will conclude the tutorial by outlining emerging research problems in this area.
