Pre-training Methods for Neural Machine Translation | Mingxuan Wang | this tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to make the most of pre-training for neural machine translation. firstly , we will briefly introduce the background of nmt , pre-training methodology , and point out the main challenges when applying pre-training for nmt. then we will focus on analysing the role of pre-training in enhancing the performance of nmt , how to design a better pre-training model for executing specific nmt tasks and how to better integrate the pre-trained model into nmt system. in each part , we will provide examples , discuss training techniques and analyse what is transferred when applying pre-training.
