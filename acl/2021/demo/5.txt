SciConceptMiner: A system for large-scale scientific concept discovery | Zhihong Shen | scientific knowledge is evolving at an unprecedented rate of speed , with new concepts constantly being introduced from millions of academic articles published every month. in this paper , we introduce a self-supervised end-to-end system , sciconceptminer , for the automatic capture of emerging scientific concepts from both independent knowledge sources \( semi-structured data \) and academic publications \( unstructured documents \) . first , we adopt a bert-based sequence labeling model to predict candidate concept phrases with self-supervision data. then , we incorporate rich web content for synonym detection and concept selection via a web search api. this two-stage approach achieves highly accurate \( 94.7% \) concept identification with more than 740k scientific concepts. these concepts are deployed in the microsoft academic production system and are the backbone for its semantic search capability.
