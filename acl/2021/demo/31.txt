TweeNLP: A Twitter Exploration Portal for Natural Language Processing | Viraj Shah | we present tweenlp , a one-stop portal that organizes twitterâ€™s natural language processing \( nlp \) data and builds a visualization and exploration platform. it curates 19 , 395 tweets \( as of april 2021 \) from various nlp conferences and general nlp discussions. it supports multiple features such as tweetexplorer to explore tweets by topics , visualize insights from twitter activity throughout the organization cycle of conferences , discover popular research papers and researchers. it also builds a timeline of conference and workshop submission deadlines. we envision tweenlp to function as a collective memory unit for the nlp community by integrating the tweets pertaining to research papers with the nlpexplorer scientific literature search engine. the current system is hosted at http://nlpexplorer.org/twitter/cfp.
