SummVis: Interactive Visual Analysis of Models, Data, and Evaluation for Text Summarization | Jesse Vig | novel neural architectures , training strategies , and the availability of large-scale corpora haven been the driving force behind recent progress in abstractive text summarization. however , due to the black-box nature of neural models , uninformative evaluation metrics , and scarce tooling for model and data analysis the true performance and failure modes of summarization models remain largely unknown. to address this limitation , we introduce summvis , an open-source tool for visualizing abstractive summaries that enables fine-grained analysis of the models , data , and evaluation metrics associated with text summarization. through its lexical and semantic visualizations , the tools offers an easy entry point for in-depth model prediction exploration across important dimensions such as factual consistency or abstractiveness. the tool together with several pre-computed model outputs is available at https://summvis.com.
