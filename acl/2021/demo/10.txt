CogIE: An Information Extraction Toolkit for Bridging Texts and CogNet | Zhuoran Jin | cognet is a knowledge base that integrates three types of knowledge: linguistic knowledge , world knowledge and commonsense knowledge. in this paper , we propose an information extraction toolkit , called cogie , which is a bridge connecting raw texts and cognet. cogie has three features: versatile , knowledge-grounded and extensible. first , cogie is a versatile toolkit with a rich set of functional modules , including named entity recognition , entity typing , entity linking , relation extraction , event extraction and frame-semantic parsing. second , as a knowledge-grounded toolkit , cogie can ground the extracted facts to cognet and leverage different types of knowledge to enrich extracted results. third , for extensibility , owing to the design of three-tier architecture , cogie is not only a plug-and-play toolkit for developers but also an extensible programming framework for researchers. we release an open-access online system to visually extract information from texts. source code , datasets and pre-trained models are publicly available at github , with a short instruction video.
