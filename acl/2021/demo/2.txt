The Classical Language Toolkit: An NLP Framework for Pre-Modern Languages | Kyle P. Johnson | this paper announces version 1.0 of the classical language toolkit \( cltk \) , an nlp framework for pre-modern languages. the vast majority of nlp , its algorithms and software , is created with assumptions particular to living languages , thus neglecting certain important characteristics of largely non-spoken historical languages. further , scholars of pre-modern languages often have different goals than those of living-language researchers. to fill this void , the cltk adapts ideas from several leading nlp frameworks to create a novel software architecture that satisfies the unique needs of pre-modern languages and their researchers. its centerpiece is a modular processing pipeline that balances the competing demands of algorithmic diversity with pre-configured defaults. the cltk currently provides pipelines , including models , for almost 20 languages.
