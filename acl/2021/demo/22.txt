Does My Representation Capture X? Probe-Ably | Deborah Ferreira | probing \( or diagnostic classification \) has become a popular strategy for investigating whether a given set of intermediate features is present in the representations of neural models. naive probing studies may have misleading results , but various recent works have suggested more reliable methodologies that compensate for the possible pitfalls of probing. however , these best practices are numerous and fast-evolving. to simplify the process of running a set of probing experiments in line with suggested methodologies , we introduce probe-ably: an extendable probing framework which supports and automates the application of probing methods to the userâ€™s inputs.
