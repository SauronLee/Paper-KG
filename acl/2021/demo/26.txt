LOA: Logical Optimal Actions for Text-based Interaction Games | Daiki Kimura | we present logical optimal actions \( loa \) , an action decision architecture of reinforcement learning applications with a neuro-symbolic framework which is a combination of neural network and symbolic knowledge acquisition approach for natural language interaction games. the demonstration for loa experiments consists of a web-based interactive platform for text-based games and visualization for acquired knowledge for improving interpretability for trained rules. this demonstration also provides a comparison module with other neuro-symbolic approaches as well as non-symbolic state-of-the-art agent models on the same text-based games. our loa also provides open-sourced implementation in python for the reinforcement learning environment to facilitate an experiment for studying neuro-symbolic agents. demo site: https://ibm.biz/acl21-loa , code: https://github.com/ibm/loa
