TEXTOIR: An Integrated and Visualized Platform for Text Open Intent Recognition | Hanlei Zhang | textoir is the first integrated and visualized platform for text open intent recognition. it is composed of two main modules: open intent detection and open intent discovery. each module integrates most of the state-of-the-art algorithms and benchmark intent datasets. it also contains an overall framework connecting the two modules in a pipeline scheme. in addition , this platform has visualized tools for data and model management , training , evaluation and analysis of the performance from different aspects. textoir provides useful toolkits and convenient visualized interfaces for each sub-module , and designs a framework to implement a complete process to both identify known intents and discover open intents.
