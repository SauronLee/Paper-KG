PAWLS: PDF Annotation With Labels and Structure | Mark Neumann | adobeâ€™s portable document format \( pdf \) is a popular way of distributing view-only documents with a rich visual markup. this presents a challenge to nlp practitioners who wish to use the information contained within pdf documents for training models or data analysis , because annotating these documents is difficult. in this paper , we present pdf annotation with labels and structure \( pawls \) , a new annotation tool designed specifically for the pdf document format. pawls is particularly suited for mixed-mode annotation and scenarios in which annotators require extended context to annotate accurately. pawls supports span-based textual annotation , n-ary relations and freeform , non-textual bounding boxes , all of which can be exported in convenient formats for training multi-modal machine learning models. a read-only pawls server is available at https://pawls.apps.allenai.org/ , and the source code is available at https://github.com/allenai/pawls.
