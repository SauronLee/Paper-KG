Neural Extractive Search | Shauli Ravfogel | domain experts often need to extract structured information from large corpora. we advocate for a search paradigm called “extractive search” , in which a search query is enriched with capture-slots , to allow for such rapid extraction. such an extractive search system can be built around syntactic structures , resulting in high-precision , low-recall results. we show how the recall can be improved using neural retrieval and alignment. the goals of this paper are to concisely introduce the extractive-search paradigm; and to demonstrate a prototype neural retrieval system for extractive search and its benefits and potential. our prototype is available at
