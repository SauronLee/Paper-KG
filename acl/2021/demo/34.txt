Exploring Word Usage Change with Continuously Evolving Embeddings | Franziska Horn | the usage of individual words can change over time , for example , when words experience a semantic shift. as text datasets generally comprise documents that were collected over a longer period of time , examining word usage changes in a corpus can often reveal interesting patterns. in this paper , we introduce a simple and intuitive way to track word usage changes via continuously evolving embeddings , computed as a weighted running average of transformer-based contextualized embeddings. we demonstrate our approach on a corpus of recent new york times article snippets and provide code for an easy to use web app to conveniently explore semantic shifts with interactive plots.
