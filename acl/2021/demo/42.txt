OpenAttack: An Open-source Textual Adversarial Attack Toolkit | Guoyang Zeng | textual adversarial attacking has received wide and increasing attention in recent years. various attack models have been proposed , which are enormously distinct and implemented with different programming frameworks and settings. these facts hinder quick utilization and fair comparison of attack models. in this paper , we present an open-source textual adversarial attack toolkit named openattack to solve these issues. compared with existing other textual adversarial attack toolkits , openattack has its unique strengths in support for all attack types , multilinguality , and parallel processing. currently , openattack includes 15 typical attack models that cover all attack types. its highly inclusive modular design not only supports quick utilization of existing attack models , but also enables great flexibility and extensibility. openattack has broad uses including comparing and evaluating attack models , measuring robustness of a model , assisting in developing new attack models , and adversarial training. source code and documentation can be obtained at https://github.com/thunlp/openattack.
