fastHan: A BERT-based Multi-Task Toolkit for Chinese NLP | Zhichao Geng | we present fasthan , an open-source toolkit for four basic tasks in chinese natural language processing: chinese word segmentation \( cws \) , part-of-speech \( pos \) tagging , named entity recognition \( ner \) , and dependency parsing. the backbone of fasthan is a multi-task model based on a pruned bert , which uses the first 8 layers in bert. we also provide a 4-layer base model compressed from the 8-layer model. the joint-model is trained and evaluated on 13 corpora of four tasks , yielding near state-of-the-art \( sota \) performance in dependency parsing and ner , achieving sota performance in cws and pos. besides , fasthanâ€™s transferability is also strong , performing much better than popular segmentation tools on a non-training corpus. to better meet the need of practical application , we allow users to use their own labeled data to further fine-tune fasthan. in addition to its small size and excellent performance , fasthan is user-friendly. implemented as a python package , fasthan isolates users from the internal technical details and is convenient to use. the project is released on github.
