Many-to-English Machine Translation Tools, Data, and Pretrained Models | Thamme Gowda | while there are more than 7000 languages in the world , most translation research efforts have targeted a few high resource languages. commercial translation systems support only one hundred languages or fewer , and do not make these models available for transfer to low resource languages. in this work , we present useful tools for machine translation research: mtdata , nlcodec and rtg. we demonstrate their usefulness by creating a multilingual neural machine translation model capable of translating from 500 source languages to english. we make this multilingual model readily downloadable and usable as a service , or as a parent model for transfer-learning to even lower-resource languages.
