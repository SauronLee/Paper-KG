Erase and Rewind: Manual Correction of NLP Output through a Web Interface | Valentino Frasnelli | in this paper , we present tintful , an nlp annotation software that can be used both to manually annotate texts and to fix mistakes in nlp pipelines , such as stanford corenlp. using a paradigm similar to wiki-like systems , a user who notices some wrong annotation can easily fix it and submit the resulting \( and right \) entry back to the tool developers. moreover , tintful can be used to easily annotate data from scratch. the input documents do not need to be in a particular format: starting from the plain text , the sentences are first annotated with corenlp , then the user can edit the annotations and submit everything back through a user-friendly interface.
