TexSmart: A System for Enhanced Natural Language Understanding | Lemao Liu | this paper introduces texsmart , a text understanding system that supports fine-grained named entity recognition \( ner \) and enhanced semantic analysis functionalities. compared to most previous publicly available text understanding systems and tools , texsmart holds some unique features. first , the ner function of texsmart supports over 1 , 000 entity types , while most other public tools typically support several to \( at most \) dozens of entity types. second , texsmart introduces new semantic analysis functions like semantic expansion and deep semantic representation , that are absent in most previous systems. third , a spectrum of algorithms \( from very fast algorithms to those that are relatively slow but more accurate \) are implemented for one function in texsmart , to fulfill the requirements of different academic and industrial applications. the adoption of unsupervised or weakly-supervised algorithms is especially emphasized , with the goal of easily updating our models to include fresh data with less human annotation efforts.
