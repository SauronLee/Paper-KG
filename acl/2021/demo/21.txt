CRSLab: An Open-Source Toolkit for Building Conversational Recommender System | Kun Zhou | in recent years , conversational recommender systems \( crss \) have drawn a wide attention in the research community , which focus on providing high-quality recommendations to users via natural language conversations. however , due to diverse scenarios and data formats , existing studies on crss lack unified and standardized implementation or comparison. to tackle this challenge , we release an open-source toolkit crslab , which provides a unified and extensible framework with highly-decoupled modules to develop crss. based on this framework , we collect 6 commonly used human-annotated crs datasets and implement 19 models that include advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and pre-training models. besides , our toolkit provides a series of automatic evaluation protocols and a human-machine interaction interface to evaluate and compare different crs methods. the project and documents are released at https://github.com/rucaibox/crslab.
