Supporting Complaints Investigation for Nursing and Midwifery Regulatory Agencies | Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn | health professional regulators aim to protect the health and well-being of patients and the public by setting standards for scrutinising and overseeing the training and conduct of health and care professionals. a major task of such regulators is the investigation of complaints against practitioners. however , processing a complaint often lasts several months and is particularly costly. hence , we worked with international regulators from different countries \( the uk , us and australia \) , to develop the first decision support tool that aims to help such regulators process complaints more efficiently. our system uses state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to process complaints and predict their risk level. our tool also provides additional useful information including explanations , to help the regulatory staff interpret the prediction results , and similar past cases as well as non-compliance to regulations , to support the decision making.
