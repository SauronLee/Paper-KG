MT-Telescope: An interactive platform for contrastive evaluation of MT systems | Ricardo Rei | we present mt-telescope , a visualization platform designed to facilitate comparative analysis of the output quality of two machine translation \( mt \) systems. while automated mt evaluation metrics are commonly used to evaluate mt systems at a corpus-level , our platform supports fine-grained segment-level analysis and interactive visualisations that expose the fundamental differences in the performance of the compared systems. mt-telescope also supports dynamic corpus filtering to enable focused analysis on specific phenomena such as; translation of named entities , handling of terminology , and the impact of input segment length on translation quality. furthermore , the platform provides a bootstrapped t-test for statistical significance as a means of evaluating the rigor of the resulting system ranking. mt-telescope is open source , written in python , and is built around a user friendly and dynamic web interface. complementing other existing tools , our platform is designed to facilitate and promote the broader adoption of more rigorous analysis practices in the evaluation of mt quality.
