IntelliCAT: Intelligent Machine Translation Post-Editing with Quality Estimation and Translation Suggestion | Dongjun Lee | we present intellicat , an interactive translation interface with neural models that streamline the post-editing process on machine translation output. we leverage two quality estimation \( qe \) models at different granularities: sentence-level qe , to predict the quality of each machine-translated sentence , and word-level qe , to locate the parts of the machine-translated sentence that need correction. additionally , we introduce a novel translation suggestion model conditioned on both the left and right contexts , providing alternatives for specific words or phrases for correction. finally , with word alignments , intellicat automatically preserves the original documentâ€™s styles in the translated document. the experimental results show that post-editing based on the proposed qe and translation suggestions can significantly improve translation quality. furthermore , a user study reveals that three features provided in intellicat significantly accelerate the post-editing task , achieving a 52.9% speedup in translation time compared to translating from scratch. the interface is publicly available at https://intellicat.beringlab.com/.
