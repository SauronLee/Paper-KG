Stanford MLab at SemEval-2021 Task 8: 48 Hours Is All You Need | Patrick Liu | this paper presents our system for the quantity span identification , unit of measurement identification and value modifier classification subtasks of the measeval 2021 task. the purpose of the quantity span identification task was to locate spans of text that contain a count or measurement , consisting of a value , usually followed by a unit and occasionally additional modifiers. the goal of the modifier classification task was to determine whether an associated text fragment served to indicate range , tolerance , mean value , etc. of a quantity. the developed systems used pre-trained bert models which were fine-tuned for the task at hand. we present our system , investigate how architectural decisions affected model predictions , and conduct an error analysis. overall , our system placed 12 / 19 in the shared task and in the 2nd place for the unit subcategory.
