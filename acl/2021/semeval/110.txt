WLV-RIT at SemEval-2021 Task 5: A Neural Transformer Framework for Detecting Toxic Spans | Tharindu Ranasinghe | in recent years , the widespread use of social media has led to an increase in the generation of toxic and offensive content on online platforms. in response , social media platforms have worked on developing automatic detection methods and employing human moderators to cope with this deluge of offensive content. while various state-of-the-art statistical models have been applied to detect toxic posts , there are only a few studies that focus on detecting the words or expressions that make a post offensive. this motivates the organization of the semeval-2021 task 5: toxic spans detection competition , which has provided participants with a dataset containing toxic spans annotation in english posts. in this paper , we present the wlv-rit entry for the semeval-2021 task 5. our best performing neural transformer model achieves an 0.68 f1-score. furthermore , we develop an open-source framework for multilingual detection of offensive spans , i.e. , mudes , based on neural transformers that detect toxic spans in texts.
