SemEval-2021 Task 6: Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Texts and Images | Dimitar Dimitrov | we describe semeval-2021 task 6 on detection of persuasion techniques in texts and images: the data , the annotation guidelines , the evaluation setup , the results , and the participating systems. the task focused on memes and had three subtasks: \( i \) detecting the techniques in the text , \( ii \) detecting the text spans where the techniques are used , and \( iii \) detecting techniques in the entire meme , i.e. , both in the text and in the image. it was a popular task , attracting 71 registrations , and 22 teams that eventually made an official submission on the test set. the evaluation results for the third subtask confirmed the importance of both modalities , the text and the image. moreover , some teams reported benefits when not just combining the two modalities , e.g. , by using early or late fusion , but rather modeling the interaction between them in a joint model.
