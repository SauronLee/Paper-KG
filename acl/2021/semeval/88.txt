Stanford MLab at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Tree-Based Modelling of Lexical Complexity using Word Embeddings | Erik Rozi | this paper presents our system for the single- and multi-word lexical complexity prediction tasks of semeval task 1: lexical complexity prediction. text comprehension depends on the reader’s ability to understand the words present in it; evaluating the lexical complexity of such texts can enable readers to find an appropriate text and systems to tailor a text to an audience’s needs. we present our model pipeline , which applies a combination of embedding-based and manual features to predict lexical complexity on the complex english dataset using various tree-based and linear models. our method is ranked 27 / 54 on single-word prediction and 14 / 37 on multi-word prediction.
