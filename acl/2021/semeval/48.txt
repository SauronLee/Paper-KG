CLaC-BP at SemEval-2021 Task 8: SciBERT Plus Rules for MeasEval | Benjamin Therien | this paper explains the design of a heterogeneous system that ranked eighth in competition in semeval2021 task 8. we analyze ablation experiments and demonstrate how the system components , namely tokenizer , unit identifier , modifier classifier , and language model , affect the overall score. we compare our results to similar experiments from the literature and introduce a grouping algorithm developed in the post-evaluation phase that increased our systemâ€™s overall score , hypothetically elevating our competition rank from eight to six.
