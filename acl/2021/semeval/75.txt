Manchester Metropolitan at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Convolutional Networks for Complex Word Identification | Robert Flynn | we present two convolutional neural networks for predicting the complexity of words and phrases in context on a continuous scale. both models utilize word and character embeddings alongside lexical features as inputs. our system displays reasonable results with a pearson correlation of 0.7754 on the task as a whole. we highlight the limitations of this method in properly assessing the context of the target text , and explore the effectiveness of both systems across a range of genres. both models were submitted as part of lcp 2021 , which focuses on the identification of complex words and phrases as a context dependent , regression based task.
