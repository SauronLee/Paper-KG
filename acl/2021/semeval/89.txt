archer at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Contextualising Lexical Complexity | Irene Russo | evaluating the complexity of a target word in a sentential context is the aim of the lexical complexity prediction task at semeval-2021. this paper presents the system created to assess single words lexical complexity , combining linguistic and psycholinguistic variables in a set of experiments involving random forest and xgboost regressors. beyond encoding out-of-context information about the lemma , we implemented features based on pre-trained language models to model the target wordâ€™s in-context complexity.
