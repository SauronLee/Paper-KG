Complex words identification using word-level features for SemEval-2020 Task 1 | Jenny A. Ortiz-Zambrano | this article describes a system to predict the complexity of words for the lexical complexity prediction \( lcp \) shared task hosted at semeval 2021 \( task 1 \) with a new annotated english dataset with a likert scale. located in the lexical semantics track , the task consisted of predicting the complexity value of the words in context. a machine learning approach was carried out based on the frequency of the words and several characteristics added at word level. over these features , a supervised random forest regression algorithm was trained. several runs were performed with different values to observe the performance of the algorithm. for the evaluation , our best results reported a m.a.e score of 0.07347 , m.s.e. of 0.00938 , and r.m.s.e. of 0.096871. our experiments showed that , with a greater number of characteristics , the precision of the classification increases.
