HITMI&T at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Integrating Transformer and CRF for Toxic Spans Detection | Chenyi Wang | this paper introduces our system at semeval-2021 task 5: toxic spans detection. the task aims to accurately locate toxic spans within a text. using bio tagging scheme , we model the task as a token-level sequence labeling task. our system uses a single model built on the model of multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder. and we introduce conditional random field \( crf \) to make the model learn the constraints between tags. we use ernie as pre-trained model , which is more suitable for the task accroding to our experiments. in addition , we use adversarial training with the fast gradient method \( fgm \) to improve the robustness of the system. our system obtains 69.85% f1 score , ranking 3rd for the official evaluation.
