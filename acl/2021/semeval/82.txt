UNBNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Predicting lexical complexity with masked language models and character-level encoders | Milton King | in this paper , we present three supervised systems for english lexical complexity prediction of single and multiword expressions for semeval-2021 task 1. we explore the use of statistical baseline features , masked language models , and character-level encoders to predict the complexity of a target token in context. our best system combines information from these three sources. the results indicate that information from masked language models and character-level encoders can be combined to improve lexical complexity prediction.
