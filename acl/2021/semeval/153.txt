Tsia at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense | Zhengyi Guan | this paper describes our contribution to semeval-2021 task 7: detecting and rating humor and of-fense.this task contains two sub-tasks , sub-task 1and sub-task 2. among them , sub-task 1 containsthree sub-tasks , sub-task 1a , sub-task 1b and sub-task 1c.sub-task 1a is to predict if the text would beconsidered humorous.sub-task 1c is described asfollows: if the text is classed as humorous , predictif the humor rating would be considered controver-sial , i.e. the variance of the rating between annota-tors is higher than the median.we combined threepre-trained model with cnn to complete these twoclassification sub-tasks.sub-task 1b is to judge thedegree of humor.sub-task 2 aims to predict how of-fensive a text would be with values between 0 and5.we use the idea of regression to deal with thesetwo sub-tasks.we analyze the performance of ourmethod and demonstrate the contribution of eachcomponent of our architecture.we have achievedgood results under the combination of multiple pre-training models and optimization methods.
