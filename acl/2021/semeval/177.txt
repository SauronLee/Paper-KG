LIORI at SemEval-2021 Task 8: Ask Transformer for measurements | Adis Davletov | this work describes our approach for subtasks of semeval-2021 task 8: measeval: counts and measurements which took the official first place in the competition. to solve all subtasks we use multi-task learning in a question-answering-like manner. we also use learnable scalar weights to weight subtasksâ€™ contribution to the final loss in multi-task training. we fine-tune luke to extract quantity spans and we fine-tune roberta to extract everything related to found quantities , including quantities themselves.
