HOMADOS at SemEval-2021 Task 6: Multi-Task Learning for Propaganda Detection | Konrad Kaczy≈Ñski | among the tasks motivated by the proliferation of misinformation , propaganda detection is particularly challenging due to the deficit of fine-grained manual annotations required to train machine learning models. here we show how data from other related tasks , including credibility assessment , can be leveraged in multi-task learning \( mtl \) framework to accelerate the training process. to that end , we design a bert-based model with multiple output layers , train it in several mtl scenarios and perform evaluation against the semeval gold standard.
