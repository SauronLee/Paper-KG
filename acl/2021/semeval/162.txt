UPB at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Adversarial Multi-Task Learning for Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense | Răzvan-Alexandru Smădu | detecting humor is a challenging task since words might share multiple valences and , depending on the context , the same words can be even used in offensive expressions. neural network architectures based on transformer obtain state-of-the-art results on several natural language processing tasks , especially text classification. adversarial learning , combined with other techniques such as multi-task learning , aids neural models learn the intrinsic properties of data. in this work , we describe our adversarial multi-task network , amtl-humor , used to detect and rate humor and offensive texts from task 7 at semeval-2021. each branch from the model is focused on solving a related task , and consists of a bilstm layer followed by capsule layers , on top of bertweet used for generating contextualized embeddings. our best model consists of an ensemble of all tested configurations , and achieves a 95.66% f1-score and 94.70% accuracy for task 1a , while obtaining rmse scores of 0.6200 and 0.5318 for tasks 1b and 2 , respectively.
