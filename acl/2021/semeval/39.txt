BreakingBERT@IITK at SemEval-2021 Task 9: Statement Verification and Evidence Finding with Tables | Aditya Jindal | recently , there has been an interest in the research on factual verification and prediction over structured data like tables and graphs. to circumvent any false news incident , it is necessary to not only model and predict over structured data efficiently but also to explain those predictions. in this paper , as the part of the semeval-2021 task 9 , we tackle the problem of fact verification and evidence finding over tabular data. there are two subtasks , in which given a table and a statement/fact , the subtask a is to determine whether the statement is inferred from the tabular data and the subtask b is to determine which cells in the table provide evidence for the former subtask. we make a comparison of the baselines and state of the art approaches over the given semtabfact dataset. we also propose a novel approach cellbert to solve the task of evidence finding , as a form of natural language inference task. we obtain a 3-way f1 score of 0.69 on subtask a and an f1 score of 0.65 on subtask b.
