C3SL at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Predicting Lexical Complexity of Words in Specific Contexts with Sentence Embeddings | Raul Almeida | we present our approach to predicting lexical complexity of words in specific contexts , as entered lcp shared task 1 at semeval 2021. the approach consists of separating sentences into smaller chunks , embedding them with sent2vec , and reducing the embeddings into a simpler vector used as input to a neural network , the latter for predicting the complexity of words and expressions. results show that the pre-trained sentence embeddings are not able to capture lexical complexity from the language when applied in cross-domain applications.
