AStarTwice at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Span Detection Using RoBERTa-CRF, Domain Specific Pre-Training and Self-Training | Thakur Ashutosh Suman | this paper describes our contribution to semeval-2021 task 5: toxic spans detection. our solution is built upon roberta language model and conditional random fields \( crf \) . we pre-trained roberta on civil comments dataset , enabling it to create better contextual representation for this task. we also employed the semi-supervised learning technique of self-training , which allowed us to extend our training dataset. in addition to these , we also identified some pre-processing steps that significantly improved our f1 score. our proposed system achieved a rank of 41 with an f1 score of 66.16%.
