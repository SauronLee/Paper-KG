UPB at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Combining Deep Learning and Hand-Crafted Features for Lexical Complexity Prediction | George-Eduard Zaharia | reading is a complex process which requires proper understanding of texts in order to create coherent mental representations. however , comprehension problems may arise due to hard-to-understand sections , which can prove troublesome for readers , while accounting for their specific language skills. as such , steps towards simplifying these sections can be performed , by accurately identifying and evaluating difficult structures. in this paper , we describe our approach for the semeval-2021 task 1: lexical complexity prediction competition that consists of a mixture of advanced nlp techniques , namely transformer-based language models , pre-trained word embeddings , graph convolutional networks , capsule networks , as well as a series of hand-crafted textual complexity features. our models are applicable on both subtasks and achieve good performance results , with a mae below 0.07 and a person correlation of .73 for single word identification , as well as a mae below 0.08 and a person correlation of .79 for multiple word targets. our results are just 5.46% and 6.5% lower than the top scores obtained in the competition on the first and the second subtasks , respectively.
