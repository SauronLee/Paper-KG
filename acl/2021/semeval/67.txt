Alejandro Mosquera at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Exploring Sentence and Word Features for Lexical Complexity Prediction | Alejandro Mosquera | this paper revisits feature engineering approaches for predicting the complexity level of english words in a particular context using regression techniques. our best submission to the lexical complexity prediction \( lcp \) shared task was ranked 3rd out of 48 systems for sub-task 1 and achieved pearson correlation coefficients of 0.779 and 0.809 for single words and multi-word expressions respectively. the conclusion is that a combination of lexical , contextual and semantic features can still produce strong baselines when compared against human judgement.
