THiFly_Queens at SemEval-2021 Task 9: Two-stage Statement Verification with Adaptive Ensembling and Slot-based Operation | Yuxuan Zhou | this paper describes our system for verifying statements with tables at semeval-2021 task 9. we developed a two-stage verifying system based on the latest table-based pre-trained model grappa. multiple networks are devised to verify different types of statements in the competition dataset and an adaptive model ensembling technique is applied to ensemble models in both stages. a statement-slot-based symbolic operation module is also used in our system to further improve the performance and stability of the system. our model achieves second place in the 3-way classification and fourth place in the 2-way classification evaluation. several ablation experiments show the effectiveness of different modules proposed in this paper.
