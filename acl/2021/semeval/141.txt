1213Li at SemEval-2021 Task 6: Detection of Propaganda with Multi-modal Attention and Pre-trained Models | Peiguang Li | this paper presents the solution proposed by the 1213li team for subtask 3 in semeval-2021 task 6: identifying the multiple persuasion techniques used in the multi-modal content of the meme. we explored various approaches in feature extraction and the detection of persuasion labels. our final model employs pre-trained models including roberta and resnet-50 as a feature extractor for texts and images , respectively , and adopts a label embedding layer with multi-modal attention mechanism to measure the similarity of labels with the multi-modal information and fuse features for label prediction. our proposed method outperforms the provided baseline method and achieves 3rd out of 16 participants with 0.54860/0.22830 for micro/macro f1 scores.
