Lone Pine at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Fine-Grained Detection of Hate Speech Using BERToxic | Yakoob Khan | this paper describes our approach to the toxic spans detection problem \( semeval-2021 task 5 \) . we propose bertoxic , a system that fine-tunes a pre-trained bert model to locate toxic text spans in a given text and utilizes additional post-processing steps to refine the boundaries. the post-processing steps involve \( 1 \) labeling character offsets between consecutive toxic tokens as toxic and \( 2 \) assigning a toxic label to words that have at least one token labeled as toxic. through experiments , we show that these two post-processing steps improve the performance of our model by 4.16% on the test set. we also studied the effects of data augmentation and ensemble modeling strategies on our system. our system significantly outperformed the provided baseline and achieved an f1-score of 0.683 , placing lone pine in the 17th place out of 91 teams in the competition. our code is made available at https://github.com/yakoob-khan/toxic-spans-detection
