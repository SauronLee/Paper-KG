BigGreen at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Lexical Complexity Prediction with Assembly Models | Aadil Islam | this paper describes a system submitted by team biggreen to lcp 2021 for predicting the lexical complexity of english words in a given context. we assemble a feature engineering-based model with a deep neural network model founded on bert. while bert itself performs competitively , our feature engineering-based model helps in extreme cases , eg. separating instances of easy and neutral difficulty. our handcrafted features comprise a breadth of lexical , semantic , syntactic , and novel phonological measures. visualizations of bert attention maps offer insight into potential features that transformers models may learn when fine-tuned for lexical complexity prediction. our ensembled predictions score reasonably well for the single word subtask , and we demonstrate how they can be harnessed to perform well on the multi word expression subtask too.
