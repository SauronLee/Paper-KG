NEUer at SemEval-2021 Task 4: Complete Summary Representation by Filling Answers into Question for Matching Reading Comprehension | Zhixiang Chen | semeval task 4 aims to find a proper option from multiple candidates to resolve the task of machine reading comprehension. most existing approaches propose to concat question and option together to form a context-aware model. however , we argue that straightforward concatenation can only provide a coarse-grained context for the mrc task , ignoring the specific positions of the option relative to the question. in this paper , we propose a novel mrc model by filling options into the question to produce a fine-grained context \( defined as summary \) which can better reveal the relationship between option and question. we conduct a series of experiments on the given dataset , and the results show that our approach outperforms other counterparts to a large extent.
