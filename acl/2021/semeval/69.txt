PolyU CBS-Comp at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP) | Rong Xiang | in this contribution , we describe the system presented by the polyu cbs-comp team at the task 1 of semeval 2021 , where the goal was the estimation of the complexity of words in a given sentence context. our top system , based on a combination of lexical , syntactic , word embeddings and transformers-derived features and on a gradient boosting regressor , achieves a top correlation score of 0.754 on the subtask 1 for single words and 0.659 on the subtask 2 for multiword expressions.
