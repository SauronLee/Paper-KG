SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation (MCL-WiC) | Federico Martelli | in this paper , we introduce the first semeval task on multilingual and cross-lingual word-in-context disambiguation \( mcl-wic \) . this task allows the largely under-investigated inherent ability of systems to discriminate between word senses within and across languages to be evaluated , dropping the requirement of a fixed sense inventory. framed as a binary classification , our task is divided into two parts. in the multilingual sub-task , participating systems are required to determine whether two target words , each occurring in a different context within the same language , express the same meaning or not. instead , in the cross-lingual part , systems are asked to perform the task in a cross-lingual scenario , in which the two target words and their corresponding contexts are provided in two different languages. we illustrate our task , as well as the construction of our manually-created dataset including five languages , namely arabic , chinese , english , french and russian , and the results of the participating systems. datasets and results are available at: https://github.com/sapienzanlp/mcl-wic.
