Volta at SemEval-2021 Task 9: Statement Verification and Evidence Finding with Tables using TAPAS and Transfer Learning | Devansh Gautam | tables are widely used in various kinds of documents to present information concisely. understanding tables is a challenging problem that requires an understanding of language and table structure , along with numerical and logical reasoning. in this paper , we present our systems to solve task 9 of semeval-2021: statement verification and evidence finding with tables \( sem-tab-facts \) . the task consists of two subtasks: \( a \) given a table and a statement , predicting whether the table supports the statement and \( b \) predicting which cells in the table provide evidence for/against the statement. we fine-tune tapas \( a model which extends bert’s architecture to capture tabular structure \) for both the subtasks as it has shown state-of-the-art performance in various table understanding tasks. in subtask a , we evaluate how transfer learning and standardizing tables to have a single header row improves tapas’ performance. in subtask b , we evaluate how different fine-tuning strategies can improve tapas’ performance. our systems achieve an f1 score of 67.34 in subtask a three-way classification , 72.89 in subtask a two-way classification , and 62.95 in subtask b.
