SemEval-2021 Task 1: Lexical Complexity Prediction | Matthew Shardlow | this paper presents the results and main findings of semeval-2021 task 1 - lexical complexity prediction. we provided participants with an augmented version of the complex corpus \( shardlow et al. 2020 \) . complex is an english multi-domain corpus in which words and multi-word expressions \( mwes \) were annotated with respect to their complexity using a five point likert scale. semeval-2021 task 1 featured two sub-tasks: sub-task 1 focused on single words and sub-task 2 focused on mwes. the competition attracted 198 teams in total , of which 54 teams submitted official runs on the test data to sub-task 1 and 37 to sub-task 2.
