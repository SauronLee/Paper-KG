TransWiC at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Transformer-based Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation | Hansi Hettiarachchi | identifying whether a word carries the same meaning or different meaning in two contexts is an important research area in natural language processing which plays a significant role in many applications such as question answering , document summarisation , information retrieval and information extraction. most of the previous work in this area rely on language-specific resources making it difficult to generalise across languages. considering this limitation , our approach to semeval-2021 task 2 is based only on pretrained transformer models and does not use any language-specific processing and resources. despite that , our best model achieves 0.90 accuracy for english-english subtask which is very compatible compared to the best result of the subtask; 0.93 accuracy. our approach also achieves satisfactory results in other monolingual and cross-lingual language pairs as well.
