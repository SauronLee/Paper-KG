NLPIITR at SemEval-2021 Task 6: RoBERTa Model with Data Augmentation for Persuasion Techniques Detection | Vansh Gupta | this paper describes and examines different systems to address task 6 of semeval-2021: detection of persuasion techniques in texts and images , subtask 1. the task aims to build a model for identifying rhetorical and psycho- logical techniques \( such as causal oversimplification , name-calling , smear \) in the textual content of a meme which is often used in a disinformation campaign to influence the users. the paper provides an extensive comparison among various machine learning systems as a solution to the task. we elaborate on the pre-processing of the text data in favor of the task and present ways to overcome the class imbalance. the results show that fine-tuning a roberta model gave the best results with an f1-micro score of 0.51 on the development set.
