UniParma at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Spans Detection Using CharacterBERT and Bag-of-Words Model | Akbar Karimi | with the ever-increasing availability of digital information , toxic content is also on the rise. therefore , the detection of this type of language is of paramount importance. we tackle this problem utilizing a combination of a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model \( characterbert \) and a traditional bag-of-words technique. since the content is full of toxic words that have not been written according to their dictionary spelling , attendance to individual characters is crucial. therefore , we use characterbert to extract features based on the word characters. it consists of a charactercnn module that learns character embeddings from the context. these are , then , fed into the well-known bert architecture. the bag-of-words method , on the other hand , further improves upon that by making sure that some frequently used toxic words get labeled accordingly. with a âˆ¼4 percent difference from the first team , our system ranked 36 th in the competition. the code is available for further research and reproduction of the results.
