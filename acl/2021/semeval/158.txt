CS-UM6P at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Deep Multi-Task Learning Model for Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense | Kabil Essefar | humor detection has become a topic of interest for several research teams , especially those involved in socio-psychological studies , with the aim to detect the humor and the temper of a targeted population \( e.g. a community , a city , a country , the employees of a given company \) . most of the existing studies have formulated the humor detection problem as a binary classification task , whereas it revolves around learning the sense of humor by evaluating its different degrees. in this paper , we propose an end-to-end deep multi-task learning \( mtl \) model to detect and rate humor and offense. it consists of a pre-trained transformer encoder and task-specific attention layers. the model is trained using mtl uncertainty loss weighting to adaptively combine all sub-tasks objective functions. our mtl model tackles all sub-tasks of the semeval-2021 task-7 in one end-to-end deep learning system and shows very promising results.
