RedwoodNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Ensembled Pretrained and Lightweight Models for Humor Detection | Nathan Chi | an understanding of humor is an essential component of human-facing nlp systems. in this paper , we investigate several methods for detecting humor in short statements as part of semeval-2021 shared task 7. for task 1a , we apply an ensemble of fine-tuned pre-trained language models; for tasks 1b , 1c , and 2a , we investigate various tree-based and linear machine learning models. our final system achieves an f1-score of 0.9571 \( ranked 24 / 58 \) on task 1a , an rmse of 0.5580 \( ranked 18 / 50 \) on task 1b , an f1-score of 0.5024 \( ranked 26 / 36 \) on task 1c , and an rmse of 0.7229 \( ranked 45 / 48 \) on task 2a.
