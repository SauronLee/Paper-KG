RS_GV at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Sense Relative Lexical Complexity Prediction | Regina Stodden | we present the technical report of the system called rs_gv at semeval-2021 task 1 on lexical complexity prediction of english words. rs_gv is a neural network using hand-crafted linguistic features in combination with character and word embeddings to predict target wordsâ€™ complexity. for the generation of the hand-crafted features , we set the target words in relation to their senses. rs_gv predicts the complexity well of biomedical terms but it has problems with the complexity prediction of very complex and very simple target words.
