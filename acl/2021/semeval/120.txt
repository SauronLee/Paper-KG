UAntwerp at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Spans are Spans, stacking a binary word level approach to toxic span detection | Ben Burtenshaw | this paper describes the system developed by the antwerp centre for digital humanities and literary criticism [uantwerp] for toxic span detection. we used a stacked generalisation ensemble of five component models , with two distinct interpretations of the task. two models attempted to predict binary word toxicity based on ngram sequences , whilst 3 categorical span based models were trained to predict toxic token labels based on complete sequence tokens. the five modelsâ€™ predictions were ensembled within an lstm model. as well as describing the system , we perform error analysis to explore model performance in relation to textual features. the system described in this paper scored 0.6755 and ranked 26th.
