KGP at SemEval-2021 Task 8: Leveraging Multi-Staged Language Models for Extracting Measurements, their Attributes and Relations | Neel Karia | semeval-2021 task 8: measeval aims at improving the machine understanding of measurements in scientific texts through a set of entity and semantic relation extraction sub-tasks on identifying quantity spans along with various attributes and relationships. this paper describes our system , consisting of a three-stage pipeline , that leverages pre-trained language models to extract the quantity spans in the text , followed by intelligent templates to identify units and modifiers. finally , it identifies the quantity attributes and their relations using language models boosted with a feature re-using hierarchical architecture and multi-task learning. our submission significantly outperforms the baseline , with the best model from the post-evaluation phase delivering more than 100% increase on f1 \( overall \) from the baseline.
