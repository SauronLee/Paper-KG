CLULEX at SemEval-2021 Task 1: A Simple System Goes a Long Way | Greta Smolenska | this paper presents the system we submitted to the first lexical complexity prediction \( lcp \) shared task 2021. the shared task provides participants with a new english dataset that includes context of the target word. we participate in the single-word complexity prediction sub-task and focus on feature engineering. our best system is trained on linguistic features and word embeddings \( pearson’s score of 0.7942 \) . we demonstrate , however , that a simpler feature set achieves comparable results and submit a model trained on 36 linguistic features \( pearson’s score of 0.7925 \) .
