SemEval 2021 Task 7: HaHackathon, Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense | J. A. Meaney | semeval 2021 task 7 , hahackathon , was the first shared task to combine the previously separate domains of humor detection and offense detection. we collected 10 , 000 texts from twitter and the kaggle short jokes dataset , and had each annotated for humor and offense by 20 annotators aged 18-70. our subtasks were binary humor detection , prediction of humor and offense ratings , and a novel controversy task: to predict if the variance in the humor ratings was higher than a specific threshold. the subtasks attracted 36-58 submissions , with most of the participants choosing to use pre-trained language models. many of the highest performing teams also implemented additional optimization techniques , including task-adaptive training and adversarial training. the results suggest that the participating systems are well suited to humor detection , but that humor controversy is a more challenging task. we discuss which models excel in this task , which auxiliary techniques boost their performance , and analyze the errors which were not captured by the best systems.
