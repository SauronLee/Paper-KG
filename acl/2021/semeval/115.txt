LISAC FSDM USMBA at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Tackling Toxic Spans Detection Challenge with Supervised SpanBERT-based Model and Unsupervised LIME-based Model | Abdessamad Benlahbib | toxic spans detection is an emerging challenge that aims to find toxic spans within a toxic text. in this paper , we describe our solutions to tackle toxic spans detection. the first solution , which follows a supervised approach , is based on spanbert model. this latter is intended to better embed and predict spans of text. the second solution , which adopts an unsupervised approach , combines linear support vector machine with the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations \( lime \) . this last is used to interpret predictions of learning-based models. our supervised model outperformed the unsupervised model and achieved the f-score of 67 , 84% \( ranked 22/85 \) in task 5 at semeval-2021: toxic spans detection.
