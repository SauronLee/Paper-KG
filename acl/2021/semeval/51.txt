BOUN at SemEval-2021 Task 9: Text Augmentation Techniques for Fact Verification in Tabular Data | Abdullatif KÃ¶ksal | in this paper , we present our text augmentation based approach for the table statement support subtask \( phase a \) of semeval-2021 task 9. we experiment with different text augmentation techniques such as back translation and synonym swapping using word2vec and wordnet. we show that text augmentation techniques lead to 2.5% improvement in f1 on the test set. further , we investigate the impact of domain adaptation and joint learning on fact verification in tabular data by utilizing the semtabfacts and tabfact datasets. we observe that joint learning improves the f1 scores on the semtabfacts and tabfact test sets by 3.31% and 0.77% , respectively.
