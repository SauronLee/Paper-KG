UTNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 5: A Comparative Analysis of Toxic Span Detection using Attention-based, Named Entity Recognition, and Ensemble Models | Alireza Salemi | detecting which parts of a sentence contribute to that sentence’s toxicity—rather than providing a sentence-level verdict of hatefulness— would increase the interpretability of models and allow human moderators to better understand the outputs of the system. this paper presents our team’s , utnlp , methodology and results in the semeval-2021 shared task 5 on toxic spans detection. we test multiple models and contextual embeddings and report the best setting out of all. the experiments start with keyword-based models and are followed by attention-based , named entity- based , transformers-based , and ensemble models. our best approach , an ensemble model , achieves an f1 of 0.684 in the competition’s evaluation phase.
