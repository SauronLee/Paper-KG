IITK@LCP at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Classification for Lexical Complexity Regression Task | Neil Shirude | this paper describes our contribution to semeval 2021 task 1 \( shardlow et al. , 2021 \) : lexical complexity prediction. in our approach , we leverage the electra model and attempt to mirror the data annotation scheme. although the task is a regression task , we show that we can treat it as an aggregation of several classification and regression models. this somewhat counter-intuitive approach achieved an mae score of 0.0654 for sub-task 1 and mae of 0.0811 on sub-task 2. additionally , we used the concept of weak supervision signals from gloss-bert in our work , and it significantly improved the mae score in sub-task 1.
