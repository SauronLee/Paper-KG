YoungSheldon at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Fine-tuning Is All You Need | Mayukh Sharma | in this paper , we describe our system used for semeval 2021 task 7: hahackathon: detecting and rating humor and offense. we used a simple fine-tuning approach using different pre-trained language models \( plms \) to evaluate their performance for humor and offense detection. for regression tasks , we averaged the scores of different models leading to better performance than the original models. we participated in all subtasks. our best performing system was ranked 4 in subtask 1-b , 8 in subtask 1-c , 12 in subtask 2 , and performed well in subtask 1-a. we further show comprehensive results using different pre-trained language models which will help as baselines for future work.
