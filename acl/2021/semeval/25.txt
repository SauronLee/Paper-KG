UPB at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Virtual Adversarial Training for Toxic Spans Detection | Andrei Paraschiv | the real-world impact of polarization and toxicity in the online sphere marked the end of 2020 and the beginning of this year in a negative way. semeval-2021 , task 5 - toxic spans detection is based on a novel annotation of a subset of the jigsaw unintended bias dataset and is the first language toxicity detection task dedicated to identifying the toxicity-level spans. for this task , participants had to automatically detect character spans in short comments that render the message as toxic. our model considers applying virtual adversarial training in a semi-supervised setting during the fine-tuning process of several transformer-based models \( i.e. , bert and roberta \) , in combination with conditional random fields. our approach leads to performance improvements and more robust models , enabling us to achieve an f1-score of 65.73% in the official submission and an f1-score of 66.13% after further tuning during post-evaluation.
