BennettNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Spans Detection using Stacked Embedding Powered Toxic Entity Recognizer | Harsh Kataria | with the rapid growth in technology , social media activity has seen a boom across all age groups. it is humanly impossible to check all the tweets , comments and status manually whether they follow proper community guidelines. a lot of toxicity is regularly posted on these social media platforms. this research aims to find toxic words in a sentence so that a healthy social community is built across the globe and the users receive censored content with specific warnings and facts. to solve this challenging problem , authors have combined concepts of linked list for pre-processing and then used the idea of stacked embeddings like bert embeddings , flair embeddings and word2vec on the flairnlp framework to get the desired results. f1 metric was used to evaluate the model. the authors were able to produce a 0.74 f1 score on their test set.
