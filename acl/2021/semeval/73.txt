Cambridge at SemEval-2021 Task 1: An Ensemble of Feature-Based and Neural Models for Lexical Complexity Prediction | Zheng Yuan | this paper describes our submission to the semeval-2021 shared task on lexical complexity prediction. we approached it as a regression problem and present an ensemble combining four systems , one feature-based and three neural with fine-tuning , frequency pre-training and multi-task learning , achieving pearson scores of 0.8264 and 0.7556 on the trial and test sets respectively \( sub-task 1 \) . we further present our analysis of the results and discuss our findings.
