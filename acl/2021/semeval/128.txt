UoT-UWF-PartAI at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Self Attention Based Bi-GRU with Multi-Embedding Representation for Toxicity Highlighter | Hamed Babaei Giglou | toxic spans detection \( tsd \) task is defined as highlighting spans that make a text toxic. many works have been done to classify a given comment or document as toxic or non-toxic. however , none of those proposed models work at the token level. in this paper , we propose a self-attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit \( bigru \) with a multi-embedding representation of the tokens. our proposed model enriches the representation by a combination of gpt-2 , glove , and roberta embeddings , which led to promising results. experimental results show that our proposed approach is very effective in detecting span tokens.
