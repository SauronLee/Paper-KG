LAST at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Improving Multi-Word Complexity Prediction Using Bigram Association Measures | Yves Bestgen | this paper describes the system developed by the laboratoire dâ€™analyse statistique des textes \( last \) for the lexical complexity prediction shared task at semeval-2021. the proposed system is made up of a lightgbm model fed with features obtained from many word frequency lists , published lexical norms and psychometric data. for tackling the specificity of the multi-word task , it uses bigram association measures. despite that the only contextual feature used was sentence length , the system achieved an honorable performance in the multi-word task , but poorer in the single word task. the bigram association measures were found useful , but to a limited extent.
