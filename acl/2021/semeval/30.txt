HamiltonDinggg at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Investigating Toxic Span Detection using RoBERTa Pre-training | Huiyang Ding | this paper presents our system submission to task 5: toxic spans detection of the semeval-2021 competition. the competition aims at detecting the spans that make a toxic span toxic. in this paper , we demonstrate our system for detecting toxic spans , which includes expanding the toxic training set with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations \( lime \) , fine-tuning roberta model for detection , and error analysis. we found that feeding the model with an expanded training set using reddit comments of polarized-toxicity and labeling with lime on top of logistic regression classification could help roberta more accurately learn to recognize toxic spans. we achieved a span-level f1 score of 0.6715 on the testing phase. our quantitative and qualitative results show that the predictions from our system could be a good supplement to the gold training setâ€™s annotations.
