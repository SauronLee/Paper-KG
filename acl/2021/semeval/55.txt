The University of Arizona at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Applying Self-training, Active Learning and Data Augmentation to Source-free Domain Adaptation | Xin Su | this paper describes our systems for negation detection and time expression recognition in semeval 2021 task 10 , source-free domain adaptation for semantic processing. we show that self-training , active learning and data augmentation techniques can improve the generalization ability of the model on the unlabeled target domain data without accessing source domain data. we also perform detailed ablation studies and error analyses for our time expression recognition systems to identify the source of the performance improvement and give constructive feedback on the temporal normalization annotation guidelines.
