HLE-UPC at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Multi-Depth DistilBERT for Toxic Spans Detection | Rafel Palliser-Sans | this paper presents our submission to semeval-2021 task 5: toxic spans detection. the purpose of this task is to detect the spans that make a text toxic , which is a complex labour for several reasons. firstly , because of the intrinsic subjectivity of toxicity , and secondly , due to toxicity not always coming from single words like insults or offends , but sometimes from whole expressions formed by words that may not be toxic individually. following this idea of focusing on both single words and multi-word expressions , we study the impact of using a multi-depth distilbert model , which uses embeddings from different layers to estimate the final per-token toxicity. our quantitative results show that using information from multiple depths boosts the performance of the model. finally , we also analyze our best model qualitatively.
