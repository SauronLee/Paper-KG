ECNU_ICA_1 SemEval-2021 Task 4: Leveraging Knowledge-enhanced Graph Attention Networks for Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning | Pingsheng Liu | this paper describes our system for semeval-2021 task 4: reading comprehension of abstract meaning. to accomplish this task , we utilize the knowledge-enhanced graph attention network \( kegat \) architecture with a novel semantic space transformation strategy. it leverages heterogeneous knowledge to learn adequate evidences , and seeks for an effective semantic space of abstract concepts to better improve the ability of a machine in understanding the abstract meaning of natural language. experimental results show that our system achieves strong performance on this task in terms of both imperceptibility and nonspecificity.
