FPAI at SemEval-2021 Task 6: BERT-MRC for Propaganda Techniques Detection | Xiaolong Hou | the objective of subtask 2 of semeval-2021 task 6 is to identify techniques used together with the span \( s \) of text covered by each technique. this paper describes the system and model we developed for the task. we first propose a pipeline system to identify spans , then to classify the technique in the input sequence. but it severely suffers from handling the overlapping in nested span. then we propose to formulize the task as a question answering task by mrc framework which achieves a better result compared to the pipeline method. moreover , data augmentation and loss design techniques are also explored to alleviate the problem of data sparse and imbalance. finally , we attain the 3rd place in the final evaluation phase.
