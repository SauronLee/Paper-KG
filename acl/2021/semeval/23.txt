IITK@Detox at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Semi-Supervised Learning and Dice Loss for Toxic Spans Detection | Archit Bansal | in this work , we present our approach and findings for semeval-2021 task 5 - toxic spans detection. the task’s main aim was to identify spans to which a given text’s toxicity could be attributed. the task is challenging mainly due to two constraints: the small training dataset and imbalanced class distribution. our paper investigates two techniques , semi-supervised learning and learning with self-adjusting dice loss , for tackling these challenges. our submitted system \( ranked ninth on the leader board \) consisted of an ensemble of various pre-trained transformer language models trained using either of the above-proposed techniques.
