SemEval-2021 Task 9: Fact Verification and Evidence Finding for Tabular Data in Scientific Documents (SEM-TAB-FACTS) | Nancy X. R. Wang | understanding tables is an important and relevant task that involves understanding table structure as well as being able to compare and contrast information within cells. in this paper , we address this challenge by presenting a new dataset and tasks that addresses this goal in a shared task in semeval 2020 task 9: fact verification and evidence finding for tabular data in scientific documents \( sem-tab-facts \) . our dataset contains 981 manually-generated tables and an auto-generated dataset of 1980 tables providing over 180k statement and over 16m evidence annotations. sem-tab-facts featured two sub-tasks. in sub-task a , the goal was to determine if a statement is supported , refuted or unknown in relation to a table. in sub-task b , the focus was on identifying the specific cells of a table that provide evidence for the statement. 69 teams signed up to participate in the task with 19 successful submissions to subtask a and 12 successful submissions to subtask b. we present our results and main findings from the competition.
