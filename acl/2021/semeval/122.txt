Sefamerve ARGE at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Spans Detection Using Segmentation Based 1-D Convolutional Neural Network Model | Selman Delil | this paper describes our contribution to semeval-2021 task 5: toxic spans detection. our approach considers toxic spans detection as a segmentation problem. the system , waw-unet , consists of a 1-d convolutional neural network adopted from u-net architecture commonly applied for semantic segmentation. we customize existing architecture by adding a special network block considering for text segmentation , as an essential component of the model. we compared the model with two transformers-based systems roberta and xlm-roberta to see its performance against pre-trained language models. we obtained 0.6251 f1 score with waw-unet while 0.6390 and 0.6601 with the compared models respectively.
