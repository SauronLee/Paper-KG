ECNUICA at SemEval-2021 Task 11: Rule based Information Extraction Pipeline | Jiaju Lin | this paper presents our endeavor for solving task11 , nlpcontributiongraph , of semeval-2021. the purpose of the task was to extract triples from a paper in the nature language processing field for constructing an open research knowledge graph. the task includes three sub-tasks: detecting the contribution sentences in papers , identifying scientific terms and predicate phrases from the contribution sentences; and inferring triples in the form of \( subject , predicate , object \) as statements for knowledge graph building. in this paper , we apply an ensemble of various fine-tuned pre-trained language models \( plm \) for tasks one and two. in addition , self-training methods are adopted for tackling the shortage of annotated data. for the third task , rather than using classic neural open information extraction \( oie \) architectures , we generate potential triples via manually designed rules and develop a binary classifier to differentiate positive ones from others. the quantitative results show that we obtain the 4th , 2nd , and 2nd rank in three evaluation phases.
