Humor@IITK at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Large Language Models for Quantifying Humor and Offensiveness | Aishwarya Gupta | humor and offense are highly subjective due to multiple word senses , cultural knowledge , and pragmatic competence. hence , accurately detecting humorous and offensive texts has several compelling use cases in recommendation systems and personalized content moderation. however , due to the lack of an extensive labeled dataset , most prior works in this domain havenâ€™t explored large neural models for subjective humor understanding. this paper explores whether large neural models and their ensembles can capture the intricacies associated with humor/offense detection and rating. our experiments on the semeval-2021 task 7: hahackathon show that we can develop reasonable humor and offense detection systems with such models. our models are ranked 3rd in subtask 1b and consistently ranked around the top 33% of the leaderboard for the remaining subtasks.
