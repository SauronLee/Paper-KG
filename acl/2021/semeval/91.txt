GX at SemEval-2021 Task 2: BERT with Lemma Information for MCL-WiC Task | Wanying Xie | this paper presents the gx system for the multilingual and cross-lingual word-in-context disambiguation \( mcl-wic \) task. the purpose of the mcl-wic task is to tackle the challenge of capturing the polysemous nature of words without relying on a fixed sense inventory in a multilingual and cross-lingual setting. to solve the problems , we use context-specific word embeddings from bert to eliminate the ambiguity between words in different contexts. for languages without an available training corpus , such as chinese , we use neuron machine translation model to translate the english data released by the organizers to obtain available pseudo-data. in this paper , we apply our system to the english and chinese multilingual setting and the experimental results show that our method has certain advantages.
