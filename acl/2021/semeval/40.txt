SemEval-2021 Task 12: Learning with Disagreements | Alexandra Uma | disagreement between coders is ubiquitous in virtually all datasets annotated with human judgements in both natural language processing and computer vision. however , most supervised machine learning methods assume that a single preferred interpretation exists for each item , which is at best an idealization. the aim of the semeval-2021 shared task on learning with disagreements \( le-wi-di \) was to provide a unified testing framework for methods for learning from data containing multiple and possibly contradictory annotations covering the best-known datasets containing information about disagreements for interpreting language and classifying images. in this paper we describe the shared task and its results.
