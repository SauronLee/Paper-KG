PTST-UoM at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Parsimonious Transfer for Sequence Tagging | Kemal Kurniawan | this paper describes ptst , a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation technique for sequence tagging , and its application to the semeval-2021 task 10 on time expression recognition. ptst is an extension of the cross-lingual parsimonious parser transfer framework , which uses high-probability predictions of the source model as a supervision signal in self-training. we extend the framework to a sequence prediction setting , and demonstrate its applicability to unsupervised domain adaptation. ptst achieves f1 score of 79.6% on the official test set , with the precision of 90.1% , the highest out of 14 submissions.
