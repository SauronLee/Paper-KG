LT3 at SemEval-2021 Task 6: Using Multi-Modal Compact Bilinear Pooling to Combine Visual and Textual Understanding in Memes | Pranaydeep Singh | internet memes have become ubiquitous in social media networks today. due to their popularity , they are also a widely used mode of expression to spread disinformation online. as memes consist of a mixture of text and image , they require a multi-modal approach for automatic analysis. in this paper , we describe our contribution to the semeval-2021 detection of persuasian techniques in texts and images task. we propose a multi-modal learning system , which incorporates “memebeddings” , viz. joint text and vision features by combining them with compact bilinear pooling , to automatically identify rhetorical and psychological disinformation techniques. the experimental results show that the proposed system constantly outperforms the competition’s baseline , and achieves the 2nd best macro f1-score and 14th best micro f1-score out of all participants.
