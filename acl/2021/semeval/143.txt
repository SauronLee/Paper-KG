YNU-HPCC at SemEval-2021 Task 6: Combining ALBERT and Text-CNN for Persuasion Detection in Texts and Images | Xingyu Zhu | in recent years , memes combining image and text have been widely used in social media , and memes are one of the most popular types of content used in online disinformation campaigns. in this paper , our study on the detection of persuasion techniques in texts and images in semeval-2021 task 6 is summarized. for propaganda technology detection in text , we propose a combination model of both albert and text cnn for text classification , as well as a bert-based multi-task sequence labeling model for propaganda technology coverage span detection. for the meme classification task involved in text understanding and visual feature extraction , we designed a parallel channel model divided into text and image channels. our method achieved a good performance on subtasks 1 and 3. the micro f1-scores of 0.492 , 0.091 , and 0.446 achieved on the test sets of the three subtasks ranked 12th , 7th , and 11th , respectively , and all are higher than the baseline model.
