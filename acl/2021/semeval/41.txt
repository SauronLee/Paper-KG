SemEval-2021 Task 10: Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Semantic Processing | Egoitz Laparra | this paper presents the source-free domain adaptation shared task held within semeval-2021. the aim of the task was to explore adaptation of machine-learning models in the face of data sharing constraints. specifically , we consider the scenario where annotations exist for a domain but cannot be shared. instead , participants are provided with models trained on that \( source \) data. participants also receive some labeled data from a new \( development \) domain on which to explore domain adaptation algorithms. participants are then tested on data representing a new \( target \) domain. we explored this scenario with two different semantic tasks: negation detection \( a text classification task \) and time expression recognition \( a sequence tagging task \) .
