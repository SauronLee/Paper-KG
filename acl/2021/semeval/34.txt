abcbpc at SemEval-2021 Task 7: ERNIE-based Multi-task Model for Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense | Chao Pang | this paper describes our system participated in task 7 of semeval-2021: detecting and rating humor and offense. the task is designed to detect and score humor and offense which are influenced by subjective factors. in order to obtain semantic information from a large amount of unlabeled data , we applied unsupervised pre-trained language models. by conducting research and experiments , we found that the ernie 2.0 and deberta pre-trained models achieved impressive performance in various subtasks. therefore , we applied the above pre-trained models to fine-tune the downstream neural network. in the process of fine-tuning the model , we adopted multi-task training strategy and ensemble learning method. based on the above strategy and method , we achieved rmse of 0.4959 for subtask 1b , and finally won the first place.
