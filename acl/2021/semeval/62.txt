HITSZ-HLT at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Ensemble Sequence Labeling and Span Boundary Detection for Toxic Span Detection | Qinglin Zhu | this paper presents the winning system that participated in semeval-2021 task 5: toxic spans detection. this task aims to locate those spans that attribute to the textâ€™s toxicity within a text , which is crucial for semi-automated moderation in online discussions. we formalize this task as the sequence labeling \( sl \) problem and the span boundary detection \( sbd \) problem separately and employ three state-of-the-art models. next , we integrate predictions of these models to produce a more credible and complement result. our system achieves a char-level score of 70.83% , ranking 1/91. in addition , we also explore the lexicon-based method , which is strongly interpretable and flexible in practice.
