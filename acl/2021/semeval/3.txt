SemEval-2021 Task 4: Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning | Boyuan Zheng | this paper introduces the semeval-2021 shared task 4: reading comprehension of abstract meaning \( recam \) . this shared task is designed to help evaluate the ability of machines in representing and understanding abstract concepts.given a passage and the corresponding question , a participating system is expected to choose the correct answer from five candidates of abstract concepts in cloze-style machine reading comprehension tasks. based on two typical definitions of abstractness , i.e. , the imperceptibility and nonspecificity , our task provides three subtasks to evaluate models’ ability in comprehending the two types of abstract meaning and the models’ generalizability. specifically , subtask 1 aims to evaluate how well a participating system models concepts that cannot be directly perceived in the physical world. subtask 2 focuses on models’ ability in comprehending nonspecific concepts located high in a hypernym hierarchy given the context of a passage. subtask 3 aims to provide some insights into models’ generalizability over the two types of abstractness. during the semeval-2021 official evaluation period , we received 23 submissions to subtask 1 and 28 to subtask 2. the participating teams additionally made 29 submissions to subtask 3. the leaderboard and competition website can be found at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26153. the data and baseline code are available at https://github.com/boyuanzheng010/semeval2021-reading-comprehension-of-abstract-meaning.
