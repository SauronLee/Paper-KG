Cisco at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Whatâ€™s Toxic?: Leveraging Transformers for Multiple Toxic Span Extraction from Online Comments | Sreyan Ghosh | social network platforms are generally used to share positive , constructive , and insightful content. however , in recent times , people often get exposed to objectionable content like threat , identity attacks , hate speech , insults , obscene texts , offensive remarks or bullying. existing work on toxic speech detection focuses on binary classification or on differentiating toxic speech among a small set of categories. this paper describes the system proposed by team cisco for semeval-2021 task 5: toxic spans detection , the first shared task focusing on detecting the spans in the text that attribute to its toxicity , in english language. we approach this problem primarily in two ways: a sequence tagging approach and a dependency parsing approach. in our sequence tagging approach we tag each token in a sentence under a particular tagging scheme. our best performing architecture in this approach also proved to be our best performing architecture overall with an f1 score of 0.6922 , thereby placing us 7th on the final evaluation phase leaderboard. we also explore a dependency parsing approach where we extract spans from the input sentence under the supervision of target span boundaries and rank our spans using a biaffine model. finally , we also provide a detailed analysis of our results and model performance in our paper.
