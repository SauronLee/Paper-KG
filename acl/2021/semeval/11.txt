TUDA-CCL at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Using Gradient-boosted Regression Tree Ensembles Trained on a Heterogeneous Feature Set for Predicting Lexical Complexity | Sebastian Gombert | in this paper , we present our systems submitted to semeval-2021 task 1 on lexical complexity prediction.the aim of this shared task was to create systems able to predict the lexical complexity of word tokens and bigram multiword expressions within a given sentence context , a continuous value indicating the difficulty in understanding a respective utterance. our approach relies on gradient boosted regression tree ensembles fitted using a heterogeneous feature set combining linguistic features , static and contextualized word embeddings , psycholinguistic norm lexica , wordnet , word- and character bigram frequencies and inclusion in wordlists to create a model able to assign a word or multiword expression a context-dependent complexity score. we can show that especially contextualised string embeddings can help with predicting lexical complexity.
