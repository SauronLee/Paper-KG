TAPAS at SemEval-2021 Task 9: Reasoning over tables with intermediate pre-training | Thomas MÃ¼ller | we present the tapas contribution to the shared task on statement verification and evidence finding with tables \( semeval 2021 task 9 , wang et al. \( 2021 \) \) . sem tab fact task a is a classification task of recognizing if a statement is entailed , neutral or refuted by the content of a given table. we adopt the binary tapas model of eisenschlos et al. \( 2020 \) to this task. we learn two binary classification models: a first model to predict if a statement is neutral or non-neutral and a second one to predict if it is entailed or refuted. as the shared task training set contains only entailed or refuted examples , we generate artificial neutral examples to train the first model. both models are pre-trained using a masklm objective , intermediate counter-factual and synthetic data \( eisenschlos et al. , 2020 \) and tabfact \( chen et al. , 2020 \) , a large table entailment dataset. we find that the artificial neutral examples are somewhat effective at training the first model , achieving 68.03 test f1 versus the 60.47 of a majority baseline. for the second stage , we find that the pre-training on the intermediate data and tabfact improves the results over masklm pre-training \( 68.03 vs 57.01 \) .
