NLyticsFKIE at SemEval-2021 Task 6: Detection of Persuasion Techniques In Texts And Images | Albert Pritzkau | the following system description presents our approach to the detection of persuasion techniques in texts and images. the given task has been framed as a multi-label classification problem with the different techniques serving as class labels. the multi-label classification problem is one in which a list of target variables such as our class labels is associated with every input chunk and assumes that a document can simultaneously and independently be assigned to multiple labels or classes. in order to assign class labels to the given memes , we opted for roberta \( a robustly optimized bert pretraining approach \) as a neural network architecture for token and sequence classification. starting off with a pre-trained model for language representation we fine-tuned this model on the given classification task with the provided annotated data in supervised training steps. to incorporate image features in the multi-modal setting , we rely on the pre-trained vgg-16 model architecture.
