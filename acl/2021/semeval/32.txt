HumorHunter at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Humor and Offense Recognition with Disentangled Attention | Yubo Xie | in this paper , we describe our system submitted to semeval 2021 task 7: hahackathon: detecting and rating humor and offense. the task aims at predicting whether the given text is humorous , the average humor rating given by the annotators , and whether the humor rating is controversial. in addition , the task also involves predicting how offensive the text is. our approach adopts the deberta architecture with disentangled attention mechanism , where the attention scores between words are calculated based on their content vectors and relative position vectors. we also took advantage of the pre-trained language models and fine-tuned the deberta model on all the four subtasks. we experimented with several bert-like structures and found that the large deberta model generally performs better. during the evaluation phase , our system achieved an f-score of 0.9480 on subtask 1a , an rmse of 0.5510 on subtask 1b , an f-score of 0.4764 on subtask 1c , and an rmse of 0.4230 on subtask 2a \( rank 3 on the leaderboard \) .
