S-NLP at SemEval-2021 Task 5: An Analysis of Dual Networks for Sequence Tagging | Viet Anh Nguyen | the semeval 2021 task 5: toxic spans detection is a task of identifying considered-toxic spans in text , which provides a valuable , automatic tool for moderating online contents. this paper represents the second-place method for the task , an ensemble of two approaches. while one approach relies on combining different embedding methods to extract diverse semantic and syntactic representations of words in context; the other utilizes extra data with a slightly customized self-training , a semi-supervised learning technique , for sequence tagging problems. both of our architectures take advantage of a strong language model , which was fine-tuned on a toxic classification task. although experimental evidence indicates higher effectiveness of the first approach than the second one , combining them leads to our best results of 70.77 f1-score on the test dataset.
