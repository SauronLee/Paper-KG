MedAI at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Start-to-end Tagging Framework for Toxic Spans Detection | Zhen Wang | this paper describes the system submitted to semeval 2021 task 5: toxic spans detection. the task concerns evaluating systems that detect the spans that make a text toxic when detecting such spans are possible. to address the possibly multi-span detection problem , we develop a start-to-end tagging framework on top of roberta based language model. besides , we design a custom loss function that takes distance into account. in comparison to other participating teams , our system has achieved 69.03% f1 score , which is slightly lower \( -1.8 and -1.73 \) than the top 1 \( 70.83% \) and top 2 \( 70.77% \) , respectively.
