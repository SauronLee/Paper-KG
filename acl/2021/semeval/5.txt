SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Spans Detection | John Pavlopoulos | the toxic spans detection task of semeval-2021 required participants to predict the spans of toxic posts that were responsible for the toxic label of the posts. the task could be addressed as supervised sequence labeling , using training data with gold toxic spans provided by the organisers. it could also be treated as rationale extraction , using classifiers trained on potentially larger external datasets of posts manually annotated as toxic or not , without toxic span annotations. for the supervised sequence labeling approach and evaluation purposes , posts previously labeled as toxic were crowd-annotated for toxic spans. participants submitted their predicted spans for a held-out test set and were scored using character-based f1. this overview summarises the work of the 36 teams that provided system descriptions.
