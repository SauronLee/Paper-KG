UIUC_BioNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 11: A Cascade of Neural Models for Structuring Scholarly NLP Contributions | Haoyang Liu | we propose a cascade of neural models that performs sentence classification , phrase recognition , and triple extraction to automatically structure the scholarly contributions of nlp publications. to identify the most important contribution sentences in a paper , we used a bert-based classifier with positional features \( subtask 1 \) . a bert-crf model was used to recognize and characterize relevant phrases in contribution sentences \( subtask 2 \) . we categorized the triples into several types based on whether and how their elements were expressed in text , and addressed each type using separate bert-based classifiers as well as rules \( subtask 3 \) . our system was officially ranked second in phase 1 evaluation and first in both parts of phase 2 evaluation. after fixing a submission error in pharse 1 , our approach yields the best results overall. in this paper , in addition to a system description , we also provide further analysis of our results , highlighting its strengths and limitations. we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/liu-hy/nlp-contrib-graph.
