UMUTeam at SemEval-2021 Task 7: Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense with Linguistic Features and Word Embeddings | José Antonio García-Díaz | in writing , humor is mainly based on figurative language in which words and expressions change their conventional meaning to refer to something without saying it directly. this flip in the meaning of the words prevents natural language processing from revealing the real intention of a communication and , therefore , reduces the effectiveness of tasks such as sentiment analysis or emotion detection. in this manuscript we describe the participation of the umuteam in hahackathon 2021 , whose objective is to detect and rate humorous and controversial content. our proposal is based on the combination of linguistic features with contextual and non-contextual word embeddings. we participate in all the proposed subtasks achieving our best result in the controversial humor subtask.
