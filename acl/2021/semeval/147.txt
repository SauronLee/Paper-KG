LeCun at SemEval-2021 Task 6: Detecting Persuasion Techniques in Text Using Ensembled Pretrained Transformers and Data Augmentation | Dia Abujaber | we developed a system for task 6 sub-task 1 for detecting propaganda in memes. an external dataset and augmentation data-set were used to extend the official competition data-set. data augmentation techniques were applied on the external data-set and competition data-set to come up with the augmented data-set. we trained 5 transformers \( deberta , and 4 roberta \) and ensembled them to make the prediction. we trained 1 roberta model initially on the augmented data-set for a few epochs and then fine-tuned it on the competition data-set which improved the f1-micro up to 0.1 scores. after that , another initial roberta model was trained on the external data-set merged with the augmented data-set for few epochs and fine-tuned it on the competition data-set. furthermore , we ensembled the initial models with the models after fine-tuning. for the final model in the ensemble , we trained a deberta model on the augmented data-set without fine-tuning it on the competition data-set. finally , we averaged the output of each model in the ensemble to make the prediction.
