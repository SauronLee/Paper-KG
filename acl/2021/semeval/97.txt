PAW at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation : Exploring Cross Lingual Transfer, Augmentations and Adversarial Training | Harsh Goyal | we experiment with xlm roberta for word in context disambiguation in the multi lingual and cross lingual setting so as to develop a single model having knowledge about both settings. we solve the problem as a binary classification problem and also experiment with data augmentation and adversarial training techniques. in addition , we also experiment with a 2-stage training technique. our approaches prove to be beneficial for better performance and robustness.
