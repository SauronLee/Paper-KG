Volta at SemEval-2021 Task 6: Towards Detecting Persuasive Texts and Images using Textual and Multimodal Ensemble | Kshitij Gupta | memes are one of the most popular types of content used to spread information online. they can influence a large number of people through rhetorical and psychological techniques. the task , detection of persuasion techniques in texts and images , is to detect these persuasive techniques in memes. it consists of three subtasks: \( a \) multi-label classification using textual content , \( b \) multi-label classification and span identification using textual content , and \( c \) multi-label classification using visual and textual content. in this paper , we propose a transfer learning approach to fine-tune bert-based models in different modalities. we also explore the effectiveness of ensembles of models trained in different modalities. we achieve an f1-score of 57.0 , 48.2 , and 52.1 in the corresponding subtasks.
