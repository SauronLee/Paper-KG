SemEval-2021 Task 11: NLPContributionGraph - Structuring Scholarly NLP Contributions for a Research Knowledge Graph | Jennifer D’Souza | there is currently a gap between the natural language expression of scholarly publications and their structured semantic content modeling to enable intelligent content search. with the volume of research growing exponentially every year , a search feature operating over semantically structured content is compelling. the semeval-2021 shared task nlpcontributiongraph \( a.k.a. ‘the ncg task’ \) tasks participants to develop automated systems that structure contributions from nlp scholarly articles in the english language. being the first-of-its-kind in the semeval series , the task released structured data from nlp scholarly articles at three levels of information granularity , i.e. at sentence-level , phrase-level , and phrases organized as triples toward knowledge graph \( kg \) building. the sentence-level annotations comprised the few sentences about the article’s contribution. the phrase-level annotations were scientific term and predicate phrases from the contribution sentences. finally , the triples constituted the research overview kg. for the shared task , participating systems were then expected to automatically classify contribution sentences , extract scientific terms and relations from the sentences , and organize them as kg triples. overall , the task drew a strong participation demographic of seven teams and 27 participants. the best end-to-end task system classified contribution sentences at 57.27% f1 , phrases at 46.41% f1 , and triples at 22.28% f1. while the absolute performance to generate triples remains low , as conclusion to the article , the difficulty of producing such data and as a consequence of modeling it is highlighted.
