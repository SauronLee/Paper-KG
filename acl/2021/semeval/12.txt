JCT at SemEval-2021 Task 1: Context-aware Representation for Lexical Complexity Prediction | Chaya Liebeskind | in this paper , we present our contribution in semeval-2021 task 1: lexical complexity prediction , where we integrate linguistic , statistical , and semantic properties of the target word and its context as features within a machine learning \( ml \) framework for predicting lexical complexity. in particular , we use bert contextualized word embeddings to represent the semantic meaning of the target word and its context. we participated in the sub-task of predicting the complexity score of single words
