Self-Adapter at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Entropy-based Pseudo-Labeler for Source-free Domain Adaptation | Sangwon Yoon | source-free domain adaptation is an emerging line of work in deep learning research since it is closely related to the real-world environment. we study the domain adaption in the sequence labeling problem where the model trained on the source domain data is given. we propose two methods: self-adapter and selective classifier training. self-adapter is a training method that uses sentence-level pseudo-labels filtered by the self-entropy threshold to provide supervision to the whole model. selective classifier training uses token-level pseudo-labels and supervises only the classification layer of the model. the proposed methods are evaluated on data provided by semeval-2021 task 10 and self-adapter achieves 2nd rank performance.
