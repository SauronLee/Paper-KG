UoB at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Extending Pre-Trained Language Models to Include Task and Domain-Specific Information for Toxic Span Prediction | Erik Yan | toxicity is pervasive in social media and poses a major threat to the health of online communities. the recent introduction of pre-trained language models , which have achieved state-of-the-art results in many nlp tasks , has transformed the way in which we approach natural language processing. however , the inherent nature of pre-training means that they are unlikely to capture task-specific statistical information or learn domain-specific knowledge. additionally , most implementations of these models typically do not employ conditional random fields , a method for simultaneous token classification. we show that these modifications can improve model performance on the toxic spans detection task at semeval-2021 to achieve a score within 4 percentage points of the top performing team.
