IITK at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation using Class Prototypes | Harshit Kumar | recent progress in deep learning has primarily been fueled by the availability of large amounts of annotated data that is obtained from highly expensive manual annotating pro-cesses. to tackle this issue of availability of annotated data , a lot of research has been done on unsupervised domain adaptation that tries to generate systems for an unlabelled target domain data , given labeled source domain data. however , the availability of annotated or labelled source domain dataset canâ€™t always be guaranteed because of data-privacy issues. this is especially the case with medical data , as it may contain sensitive information of the patients. source-free domain adaptation \( sfda \) aims to resolve this issue by us-ing models trained on the source data instead of using the original annotated source data. in this work , we try to build sfda systems for semantic processing by specifically focusing on the negation detection subtask of the semeval2021 task 10. we propose two approaches -protoaugandadapt-protoaugthat use the idea of self-entropy to choose reliable and high confidence samples , which are then used for data augmentation and subsequent training of the models. our methods report an improvement of up to 7% in f1 score over the baseline for the negation detection subtask.
