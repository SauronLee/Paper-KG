BLCUFIGHT at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Novel Unsupervised Frameworks For Source-Free Domain Adaptation | Weikang Wang | domain adaptation assumes that samples from source and target domains are freely accessible during a training phase. however , such assumption is rarely plausible in the real-world and may causes data-privacy issues , especially when the label of the source domain can be a sensitive attribute as an identifier. semeval-2021 task 10 focuses on these issues. we participate in the task and propose novel frameworks based on self-training method. in our systems , two different frameworks are designed to solve text classification and sequence labeling. these approaches are tested to be effective which ranks the third among all system in subtask a , and ranks the first among all system in subtask b.
