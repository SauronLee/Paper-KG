Noobs at Semeval-2021 Task 4: Masked Language Modeling for abstract answer prediction | Shikhar Shukla | this paper presents the system developed by our team for semeval 2021 task 4: reading comprehension of abstract meaning. the aim of the task was to benchmark the nlp techniques in understanding the abstract concepts present in a passage , and then predict the missing word in a human written summary of the passage. we trained a roberta-large model trained with a masked language modeling objective. in cases where this model failed to predict one of the available options , another roberta-large model trained as a binary classifier was used to predict correct and incorrect options. we used passage summary generated by pegasus model and question as inputs. our best solution was an ensemble of these 2 systems. we achieved an accuracy of 86.22% on subtask 1 and 87.10% on subtask 2.
