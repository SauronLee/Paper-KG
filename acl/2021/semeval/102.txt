LIORI at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Span Prediction and Binary Classification approaches to Word-in-Context Disambiguation | Adis Davletov | this paper presents our approaches to semeval-2021 task 2: multilingual and cross-lingual word-in-context disambiguation task. the first approach attempted to reformulate the task as a question answering problem , while the second one framed it as a binary classification problem. our best system , which is an ensemble of xlm-r based binary classifiers trained with data augmentation , is among the 3 best-performing systems for russian , french and arabic in the multilingual subtask. in the post-evaluation period , we experimented with batch normalization , subword pooling and target word occurrence aggregation methods , resulting in further performance improvements.
