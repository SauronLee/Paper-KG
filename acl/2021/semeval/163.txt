Team_KGP at SemEval-2021 Task 7: A Deep Neural System to Detect Humor and Offense with Their Ratings in the Text Data | Anik Mondal | this paper describes the system submitted to semeval-2021 task-7 for all four subtasks. two subtasks focus on detecting humor and offense from the text \( binary classification \) . on the other hand , the other two subtasks predict humor and offense ratings of the text \( linear regression \) . in this paper , we present two different types of fine-tuning methods by using linear layers and bi-lstm layers on top of the pre-trained bert model. results show that our system is able to outperform baseline models by a significant margin. we report f1 scores of 0.90 for the first subtask and 0.53 for the third subtask , while we report an rmse of 0.57 and 0.58 for the second and fourth subtasks , respectively.
