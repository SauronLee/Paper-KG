NLRG at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Spans Detection Leveraging BERT-based Token Classification and Span Prediction Techniques | Gunjan Chhablani | toxicity detection of text has been a popular nlp task in the recent years. in semeval-2021 task-5 toxic spans detection , the focus is on detecting toxic spans within english passages. most state-of-the-art span detection approaches employ various techniques , each of which can be broadly classified into token classification or span prediction approaches. in our paper , we explore simple versions of both of these approaches and their performance on the task. specifically , we use bert-based models - bert , roberta , and spanbert for both approaches. we also combine these approaches and modify them to bring improvements for toxic spans prediction. to this end , we investigate results on four hybrid approaches - multi-span , span+token , lstm-crf , and a combination of predicted offsets using union/intersection. additionally , we perform a thorough ablative analysis and analyze our observed results. our best submission - a combination of spanbert span predictor and roberta token classifier predictions - achieves an f1 score of 0.6753 on the test set. our best post-eval f1 score is 0.6895 on intersection of predicted offsets from top-3 roberta token classification checkpoints. these approaches improve the performance by 3% on average than those of the shared baseline models - rnnsl and spacy ner.
