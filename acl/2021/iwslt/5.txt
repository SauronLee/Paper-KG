The Volctrans Neural Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2021 | Chengqi Zhao | this paper describes the systems submitted to iwslt 2021 by the volctrans team. we participate in the offline speech translation and text-to-text simultaneous translation tracks. for offline speech translation , our best end-to-end model achieves 7.9 bleu improvements over the benchmark on the must-c test set and is even approaching the results of a strong cascade solution. for text-to-text simultaneous translation , we explore the best practice to optimize the wait-k model. as a result , our final submitted systems exceed the benchmark at around 7 bleu on the same latency regime. we release our code and model to facilitate both future research works and industrial applications.
