Self-Guided Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation | Lei Zhou | in supervised learning , a well-trained model should be able to recover ground truth accurately , i.e. the predicted labels are expected to resemble the ground truth labels as much as possible. inspired by this , we formulate a difficulty criterion based on the recovery degrees of training examples. motivated by the intuition that after skimming through the training corpus , the neural machine translation \( nmt \) model “knows” how to schedule a suitable curriculum according to learning difficulty , we propose a self-guided curriculum learning strategy that encourages the nmt model to learn from easy to hard on the basis of recovery degrees. specifically , we adopt sentence-level bleu score as the proxy of recovery degree. experimental results on translation benchmarks including wmt14 english-german and wmt17 chinese-english demonstrate that our proposed method considerably improves the recovery degree , thus consistently improving the translation performance.
