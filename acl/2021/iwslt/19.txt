ON-TRAC’ systems for the IWSLT 2021 low-resource speech translation and multilingual speech translation shared tasks | Hang Le | this paper describes the on-trac consortium translation systems developed for two challenge tracks featured in the evaluation campaign of iwslt 2021 , low-resource speech translation and multilingual speech translation. the on-trac consortium is composed of researchers from three french academic laboratories and an industrial partner: lia \( avignon université \) , lig \( université grenoble alpes \) , lium \( le mans université \) , and researchers from airbus. a pipeline approach was explored for the low-resource speech translation task , using a hybrid hmm/tdnn automatic speech recognition system fed by wav2vec features , coupled to an nmt system. for the multilingual speech translation task , we investigated the us of a dual-decoder transformer that jointly transcribes and translates an input speech. this model was trained in order to translate from multiple source languages to multiple target ones.
