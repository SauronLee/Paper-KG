ZJU’s IWSLT 2021 Speech Translation System | Linlin Zhang | in this paper , we describe zhejiang university’s submission to the iwslt2021 multilingual speech translation task. this task focuses on speech translation \( st \) research across many non-english source languages. participants can decide whether to work on constrained systems or unconstrained systems which can using external data. we create both cascaded and end-to-end speech translation constrained systems , using the provided data only. in the cascaded approach , we combine conformer-based automatic speech recognition \( asr \) with the transformer-based neural machine translation \( nmt \) . our end-to-end direct speech translation systems use asr pretrained encoder and multi-task decoders. the submitted systems are ensembled by different cascaded models.
