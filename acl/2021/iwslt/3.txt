The University of Edinburghâ€™s Submission to the IWSLT21 Simultaneous Translation Task | Sukanta Sen | we describe our submission to the iwslt 2021 shared task on simultaneous text-to-text english-german translation. our system is based on the re-translation approach where the agent re-translates the whole source prefix each time it receives a new source token. this approach has the advantage of being able to use a standard neural machine translation \( nmt \) inference engine with beam search , however , there is a risk that incompatibility between successive re-translations will degrade the output. to improve the quality of the translations , we experiment with various approaches: we use a fixed size wait at the beginning of the sentence , we use a language model score to detect translatable units , and we apply dynamic masking to determine when the translation is unstable. we find that a combination of dynamic masking and language model score obtains the best latency-quality trade-off.
