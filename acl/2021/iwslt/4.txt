Without Further Ado: Direct and Simultaneous Speech Translation by AppTek in 2021 | Parnia Bahar | this paper describes the offline and simultaneous speech translation systems developed at apptek for iwslt 2021. our offline st submission includes the direct end-to-end system and the so-called posterior tight integrated model , which is akin to the cascade system but is trained in an end-to-end fashion , where all the cascaded modules are end-to-end models themselves. for simultaneous st , we combine hybrid automatic speech recognition with a machine translation approach whose translation policy decisions are learned from statistical word alignments. compared to last year , we improve general quality and provide a wider range of quality/latency trade-offs , both due to a data augmentation method making the mt model robust to varying chunk sizes. finally , we present a method for asr output segmentation into sentences that introduces a minimal additional delay.
