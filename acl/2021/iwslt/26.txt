Large-Scale English-Japanese Simultaneous Interpretation Corpus: Construction and Analyses with Sentence-Aligned Data | Kosuke Doi | this paper describes the construction of a new large-scale english-japanese simultaneous interpretation \( si \) corpus and presents the results of its analysis. a portion of the corpus contains si data from three interpreters with different amounts of experience. some of the si data were manually aligned with the source speeches at the sentence level. their latency , quality , and word order aspects were compared among the si data themselves as well as against offline translations. the results showed that \( 1 \) interpreters with more experience controlled the latency and quality better , and \( 2 \) large latency hurt the si quality.
