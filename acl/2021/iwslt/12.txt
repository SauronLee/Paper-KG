KIT’s IWSLT 2021 Offline Speech Translation System | Tuan Nam Nguyen | this paper describes kit’submission to the iwslt 2021 offline speech translation task. we describe a system in both cascaded condition and end-to-end condition. in the cascaded condition , we investigated different end-to-end architectures for the speech recognition module. for the text segmentation module , we trained a small transformer-based model on high-quality monolingual data. for the translation module , our last year’s neural machine translation model was reused. in the end-to-end condition , we improved our speech relative transformer architecture to reach or even surpass the result of the cascade system.
