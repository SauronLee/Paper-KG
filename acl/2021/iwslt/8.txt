The NiuTrans End-to-End Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2021 Offline Task | Chen Xu | this paper describes the submission of the niutrans end-to-end speech translation system for the iwslt 2021 offline task , which translates from the english audio to german text directly without intermediate transcription. we use the transformer-based model architecture and enhance it by conformer , relative position encoding , and stacked acoustic and textual encoding. to augment the training data , the english transcriptions are translated to german translations. finally , we employ ensemble decoding to integrate the predictions from several models trained with the different datasets. combining these techniques , we achieve 33.84 bleu points on the must-c en-de test set , which shows the enormous potential of the end-to-end model.
