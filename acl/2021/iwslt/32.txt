Data Augmentation by Concatenation for Low-Resource Translation: A Mystery and a Solution | Toan Q. Nguyen | in this paper , we investigate the driving factors behind concatenation , a simple but effective data augmentation method for low-resource neural machine translation. our experiments suggest that discourse context is unlikely the cause for concatenation improving bleu by about +1 across four language pairs. instead , we demonstrate that the improvement comes from three other factors unrelated to discourse: context diversity , length diversity , and \( to a lesser extent \) position shifting.
