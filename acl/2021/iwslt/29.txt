Tag Assisted Neural Machine Translation of Film Subtitles | Aren Siekmeier | we implemented a neural machine translation system that uses automatic sequence tagging to improve the quality of translation. instead of operating on unannotated sentence pairs , our system uses pre-trained tagging systems to add linguistic features to source and target sentences. our proposed neural architecture learns a combined embedding of tokens and tags in the encoder , and simultaneous token and tag prediction in the decoder. compared to a baseline with unannotated training , this architecture increased the bleu score of german to english film subtitle translation outputs by 1.61 points using named entity tags; however , the bleu score decreased by 0.38 points using part-of-speech tags. this demonstrates that certain token-level tag outputs from off-the-shelf tagging systems can improve the output of neural translation systems using our combined embedding and simultaneous decoding extensions.
