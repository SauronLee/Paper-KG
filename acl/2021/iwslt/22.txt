mixSeq: A Simple Data Augmentation Methodfor Neural Machine Translation | Xueqing Wu | data augmentation , which refers to manipulating the inputs \( e.g. , adding random noise , masking specific parts \) to enlarge the dataset , has been widely adopted in machine learning. most data augmentation techniques operate on a single input , which limits the diversity of the training corpus. in this paper , we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation technique for neural machine translation , mixseq , which operates on multiple inputs and their corresponding targets. specifically , we randomly select two input sequences , concatenate them together as a longer input aswell as their corresponding target sequencesas an enlarged target , and train models on theaugmented dataset. experiments on nine machine translation tasks demonstrate that such asimple method boosts the baselines by a non-trivial margin. our method can be further combined with single input based data augmentation methods to obtain further improvements.
