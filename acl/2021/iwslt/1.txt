The USTC-NELSLIP Systems for Simultaneous Speech Translation Task at IWSLT 2021 | Dan Liu | this paper describes ustc-nelslipâ€™s submissions to the iwslt2021 simultaneous speech translation task. we proposed a novel simultaneous translation model , cross-attention augmented transducer \( caat \) , which extends conventional rnn-t to sequence-to-sequence tasks without monotonic constraints , e.g. , simultaneous translation. experiments on speech-to-text \( s2t \) and text-to-text \( t2t \) simultaneous translation tasks shows caat achieves better quality-latency trade-offs compared to
