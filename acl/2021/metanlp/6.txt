Multi-accent Speech Separation with One Shot Learning | Kuan Po Huang | speech separation is a problem in the field of speech processing that has been studied in full swing recently. however , there has not been much work studying a multi-accent speech separation scenario. unseen speakers with new accents and noise aroused the domain mismatch problem which cannot be easily solved by conventional joint training methods. thus , we applied maml and fomaml to tackle this problem and obtained higher average si-snri values than joint training on almost all the unseen accents. this proved that these two methods do have the ability to generate well-trained parameters for adapting to speech mixtures of new speakers and accents. furthermore , we found out that fomaml obtains similar performance compared to maml while saving a lot of time.
