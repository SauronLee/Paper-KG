Zero-Shot Compositional Concept Learning | Guangyue Xu | in this paper , we study the problem of recognizing compositional attribute-object concepts within the zero-shot learning \( zsl \) framework. we propose an episode-based cross-attention \( epica \) network which combines merits of cross-attention mechanism and episode-based training strategy to recognize novel compositional concepts. firstly , epica bases on cross-attention to correlate conceptvisual information and utilizes the gated pooling layer to build contextualized representations for both images and concepts. the updated representations are used for a more indepth multi-modal relevance calculation for concept recognition. secondly , a two-phase episode training strategy , especially the ransductive phase , is adopted to utilize unlabeled test examples to alleviate the low-resource learning problem. experiments on two widelyused zero-shot compositional learning \( zscl \) benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the model compared with recent approaches on both conventional and generalized zscl settings.
