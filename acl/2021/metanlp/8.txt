Meta-learning for Classifying Previously Unseen Data Source into Previously Unseen Emotional Categories | GaÃ«l Guibon | in this paper , we place ourselves in a classification scenario in which the target classes and data type are not accessible during training. we use a meta-learning approach to determine whether or not meta-trained information from common social network data with fine-grained emotion labels can achieve competitive performance on messages labeled with different emotion categories. we leverage few-shot learning to match with the classification scenario and consider metric learning based meta-learning by setting up prototypical networks with a transformer encoder , trained in an episodic fashion. this approach proves to be effective for capturing meta-information from a source emotional tag set to predict previously unseen emotional tags. even though shifting the data type triggers an expected performance drop , our meta-learning approach achieves decent results when compared to the fully supervised one.
