Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition | Cyprien de Lichy | meta-learning has recently been proposed to learn models and algorithms that can generalize from a handful of examples. however , applications to structured prediction and textual tasks pose challenges for meta-learning algorithms. in this paper , we apply two meta-learning algorithms , prototypical networks and reptile , to few-shot named entity recognition \( ner \) , including a method for incorporating language model pre-training and conditional random fields \( crf \) . we propose a task generation scheme for converting classical ner datasets into the few-shot setting , for both training and evaluation. using three public datasets , we show these meta-learning algorithms outperform a reasonable fine-tuned bert baseline. in addition , we propose a novel combination of prototypical networks and reptile.
