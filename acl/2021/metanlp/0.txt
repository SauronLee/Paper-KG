Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Mastering Multiple Skills and Generalizing across Environments in Text-based Games | Zhenjie Zhao | text-based games can be used to develop task-oriented text agents for accomplishing tasks with high-level language instructions , which has potential applications in domains such as human-robot interaction. given a text instruction , reinforcement learning is commonly used to train agents to complete the intended task owing to its convenience of learning policies automatically. however , because of the large space of combinatorial text actions , learning a policy network that generates an action word by word with reinforcement learning is challenging. recent research works show that imitation learning provides an effective way of training a generation-based policy network. however , trained agents with imitation learning are hard to master a wide spectrum of task types or skills , and it is also difficult for them to generalize to new environments. in this paper , we propose a meta reinforcement learning based method to train text agents through learning-to-explore. in particular , the text agent first explores the environment to gather task-specific information and then adapts the execution policy for solving the task with this information. on the publicly available testbed alfworld , we conducted a comparison study with imitation learning and show the superiority of our method.
