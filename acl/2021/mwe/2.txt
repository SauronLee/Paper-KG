Data-driven Identification of Idioms in Song Lyrics | Miriam Amin | the automatic recognition of idioms poses a challenging problem for nlp applications. whereas native speakers can intuitively handle multiword expressions whose compositional meanings are hard to trace back to individual word semantics , there is still ample scope for improvement regarding computational approaches. we assume that idiomatic constructions can be characterized by gradual intensities of semantic non-compositionality , formal fixedness , and unusual usage context , and introduce a number of measures for these characteristics , comprising count-based and predictive collocation measures together with measures of context \( un \) similarity. we evaluate our approach on a manually labelled gold standard , derived from a corpus of german pop lyrics. to this end , we apply a random forest classifier to analyze the individual contribution of features for automatically detecting idioms , and study the trade-off between recall and precision. finally , we evaluate the classifier on an independent dataset of idioms extracted from a list of wikipedia idioms , achieving state-of-the art accuracy.
