Lexical Semantic Recognition | Nelson F. Liu | in lexical semantics , full-sentence segmentation and segment labeling of various phenomena are generally treated separately , despite their interdependence. we hypothesize that a unified lexical semantic recognition task is an effective way to encapsulate previously disparate styles of annotation , including multiword expression identification / classification and supersense tagging. using the streusle corpus , we train a neural crf sequence tagger and evaluate its performance along various axes of annotation. as the label set generalizes that of previous tasks \( parseme , dimsum \) , we additionally evaluate how well the model generalizes to those test sets , finding that it approaches or surpasses existing models despite training only on streusle. our work also establishes baseline models and evaluation metrics for integrated and accurate modeling of lexical semantics , facilitating future work in this area.
