Finding BERT’s Idiomatic Key | Vasudevan Nedumpozhimana | sentence embeddings encode information relating to the usage of idioms in a sentence. this paper reports a set of experiments that combine a probing methodology with input masking to analyse where in a sentence this idiomatic information is taken from , and what form it takes. our results indicate that bert’s idiomatic key is primarily found within an idiomatic expression , but also draws on information from the surrounding context. also , bert can distinguish between the disruption in a sentence caused by words missing and the incongruity caused by idiomatic usage.
