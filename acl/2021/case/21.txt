Team “DaDeFrNi” at CASE 2021 Task 1: Document and Sentence Classification for Protest Event Detection | Francesco Re | this paper accompanies our top-performing submission to the case 2021 shared task , which is hosted at the workshop on challenges and applications of automated extraction of socio-political events from text. subtasks 1 and 2 of task 1 concern the classification of newspaper articles and sentences into “conflict” versus “not conflict”-related in four different languages. our model performs competitively in both subtasks \( up to 0.8662 macro f1 \) , obtaining the highest score of all contributions for subtask 1 on hindi articles \( 0.7877 macro f1 \) . we describe all experiments conducted with the xlm-roberta \( xlm-r \) model and report results obtained in each binary classification task. we propose supplementing the original training data with additional data on political conflict events. in addition , we provide an analysis of unigram probability estimates and geospatial references contained within the original training corpus.
