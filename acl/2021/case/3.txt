PROTEST-ER: Retraining BERT for Protest Event Extraction | Tommaso Caselli | we analyze the effect of further retraining bert with different domain specific data as an unsupervised domain adaptation strategy for event extraction. portability of event extraction models is particularly challenging , with large performance drops affecting data on the same text genres \( e.g. , news \) . we present protest-er , a retrained bert model for protest event extraction. protest-er outperforms a corresponding generic bert on out-of-domain data of 8.1 points. our best performing models reach 51.91-46.39 f1 across both domains.
