IBM MNLP IE at CASE 2021 Task 1: Multigranular and Multilingual Event Detection on Protest News | Parul Awasthy | in this paper , we present the event detection models and systems we have developed for multilingual protest news detection - shared task 1 at case 2021. the shared task has 4 subtasks which cover event detection at different granularity levels \( from document level to token level \) and across multiple languages \( english , hindi , portuguese and spanish \) . to handle data from multiple languages , we use a multilingual transformer-based language model \( xlm-r \) as the input text encoder. we apply a variety of techniques and build several transformer-based models that perform consistently well across all the subtasks and languages. our systems achieve an average f_1 score of 81.2. out of thirteen subtask-language tracks , our submissions rank 1st in nine and 2nd in four tracks.
