Extracting Events from Industrial Incident Reports | Nitin Ramrakhiyani | incidents in industries have huge social and political impact and minimizing the consequent damage has been a high priority. however , automated analysis of repositories of incident reports has remained a challenge. in this paper , we focus on automatically extracting events from incident reports. due to absence of event annotated datasets for industrial incidents we employ a transfer learning based approach which is shown to outperform several baselines. we further provide detailed analysis regarding effect of increase in pre-training data and provide explainability of why pre-training improves the performance.
