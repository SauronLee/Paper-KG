FKIE_itf_2021 at CASE 2021 Task 1: Using Small Densely Fully Connected Neural Nets for Event Detection and Clustering | Nils Becker | in this paper we present multiple approaches for event detection on document and sentence level , as well as a technique for event sentence co-reference resolution. the advantage of our co-reference resolution approach , which handles the task as a clustering problem , is that we use a single neural net to solve the task , which stands in contrast to other clustering algorithms that often are build on more complex models. this means that we can set our focus on the optimization of a single neural network instead of having to optimize numerous different parameters. we use small densely connected neural networks and pre-trained multilingual transformer embeddings in all subtasks. we use either document or sentence embeddings , depending on the task , and refrain from using word embeddings , so that the implementation of complicated network structures and unfolding of rnns , which can deal with input of different sizes , is not necessary. we achieved an average macro f1 of 0.65 in subtask 1 \( i.e. , document level classification \) , and a macro f1 of 0.70 in subtask 2 \( i.e. , sentence level classification \) . for the co-reference resolution subtask , we achieved an average conll-2012 score across all languages of 0.83.
