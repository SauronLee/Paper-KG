Modality and Negation in Event Extraction | Sander Bijl de Vroe | language provides speakers with a rich system of modality for expressing thoughts about events , without being committed to their actual occurrence. modality is commonly used in the political news domain , where both actual and possible courses of events are discussed. nlp systems struggle with these semantic phenomena , often incorrectly extracting events which did not happen , which can lead to issues in downstream applications. we present an open-domain , lexicon-based event extraction system that captures various types of modality. this information is valuable for question answering , knowledge graph construction and fact-checking tasks , and our evaluation shows that the system is sufficiently strong to be used in downstream applications.
