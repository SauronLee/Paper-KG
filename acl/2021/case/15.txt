DAAI at CASE 2021 Task 1: Transformer-based Multilingual Socio-political and Crisis Event Detection | Hansi Hettiarachchi | automatic socio-political and crisis event detection has been a challenge for natural language processing as well as social and political science communities , due to the diversity and nuance in such events and high accuracy requirements. in this paper , we propose an approach which can handle both document and cross-sentence level event detection in a multilingual setting using pretrained transformer models. our approach became the winning solution in document level predictions and secured the 3rd place in cross-sentence level predictions for the english language. we could also achieve competitive results for other languages to prove the effectiveness and universality of our approach.
