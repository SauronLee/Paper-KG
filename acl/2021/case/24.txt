CASE 2021 Task 2: Zero-Shot Classification of Fine-Grained Sociopolitical Events with Transformer Models | Benjamin J. Radford | we introduce a method for the classification of texts into fine-grained categories of sociopolitical events. this particular method is responsive to all three subtasks of task 2 , fine-grained classification of socio-political events , introduced at the case workshop of acl-ijcnlp 2021. we frame task 2 as textual entailment: given an input text and a candidate event class \( “query” \) , the model predicts whether the text describes an event of the given type. the model is able to correctly classify in-sample event types with an average f1-score of 0.74 but struggles with some out-of-sample event types. despite this , the model shows promise for the zero-shot identification of certain sociopolitical events by achieving an f1-score of 0.52 on one wholly out-of-sample event class.
