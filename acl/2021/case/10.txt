Multilingual Protest News Detection - Shared Task 1, CASE 2021 | Ali Hürriyetoğlu | benchmarking state-of-the-art text classification and information extraction systems in multilingual , cross-lingual , few-shot , and zero-shot settings for socio-political event information collection is achieved in the scope of the shared task socio-political and crisis events detection at the workshop case @ acl-ijcnlp 2021. socio-political event data is utilized for national and international policy- and decision-making. therefore , the reliability and validity of these datasets are of the utmost importance. we split the shared task into three parts to address the three aspects of data collection \( task 1 \) , fine-grained semantic classification \( task 2 \) , and evaluation \( task 3 \) . task 1 , which is the focus of this report , is on multilingual protest news detection and comprises four subtasks that are document classification \( subtask 1 \) , sentence classification \( subtask 2 \) , event sentence coreference identification \( subtask 3 \) , and event extraction \( subtask 4 \) . all subtasks had english , portuguese , and spanish for both training and evaluation data. data in hindi language was available only for the evaluation of subtask 1. the majority of the submissions , which are 238 in total , are created using multi- and cross-lingual approaches. best scores are above 77.27 f1-macro for subtask 1 , above 85.32 f1-macro for subtask 2 , above 84.23 conll 2012 average score for subtask 3 , and above 66.20 f1-macro for subtask 4 in all evaluation settings. the performance of the best system for subtask 4 is above 66.20 f1 for all available languages. although there is still a significant room for improvement in cross-lingual and zero-shot settings , the best submissions for each evaluation scenario yield remarkable results. monolingual models outperformed the multilingual models in a few evaluation scenarios.
