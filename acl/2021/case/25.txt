CASE 2021 Task 2 Socio-political Fine-grained Event Classification using Fine-tuned RoBERTa Document Embeddings | Samantha Kent | we present our submission to task 2 of the socio-political and crisis events detection shared task at the case @ acl-ijcnlp 2021 workshop. the task at hand aims at the fine-grained classification of socio-political events. our best model was a fine-tuned roberta transformer model using document embeddings. the corpus consisted of a balanced selection of sub-events extracted from the acled event dataset. we achieved a macro f-score of 0.923 and a micro f-score of 0.932 during our preliminary experiments on a held-out test set. the same model also performed best on the shared task test data \( weighted f-score = 0.83 \) . to analyze the results we calculated the topic compactness of the commonly misclassified events and conducted an error analysis.
