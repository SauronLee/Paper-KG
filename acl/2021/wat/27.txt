Multilingual Machine Translation Systems at WAT 2021: One-to-Many and Many-to-One Transformer based NMT | Shivam Mhaskar | in this paper , we present the details of the systems that we have submitted for the wat 2021 multiindicmt: an indic language multilingual task. we have submitted two separate multilingual nmt models: one for english to 10 indic languages and another for 10 indic languages to english. we discuss the implementation details of two separate multilingual nmt approaches , namely one-to-many and many-to-one , that makes use of a shared decoder and a shared encoder , respectively. from our experiments , we observe that the multilingual nmt systems outperforms the bilingual baseline mt systems for each of the language pairs under consideration.
