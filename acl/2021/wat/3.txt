NICT’s Neural Machine Translation Systems for the WAT21 Restricted Translation Task | Zuchao Li | this paper describes our system \( team id: nictrb \) for participating in the wat’21 restricted machine translation task. in our submitted system , we designed a new training approach for restricted machine translation. by sampling from the translation target , we can solve the problem that ordinary training data does not have a restricted vocabulary. with the further help of constrained decoding in the inference phase , we achieved better results than the baseline , confirming the effectiveness of our solution. in addition , we also tried the vanilla and sparse transformer as the backbone network of the model , as well as model ensembling , which further improved the final translation performance.
