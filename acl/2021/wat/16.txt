Improved English to Hindi Multimodal Neural Machine Translation | Sahinur Rahman Laskar | machine translation performs automatic translation from one natural language to another. neural machine translation attains a state-of-the-art approach in machine translation , but it requires adequate training data , which is a severe problem for low-resource language pairs translation. the concept of multimodal is introduced in neural machine translation \( nmt \) by merging textual features with visual features to improve low-resource pair translation. wat2021 \( workshop on asian translation 2021 \) organizes a shared task of multimodal translation for english to hindi. we have participated the same with team name cnlp-nits-pp in two submissions: multimodal and text-only nmt. this work investigates phrase pairs injection via data augmentation approach and attains improvement over our previous work at wat2020 on the same task in both text-only and multimodal nmt. we have achieved second rank on the challenge test set for english to hindi multimodal translation where bilingual evaluation understudy \( bleu \) score of 39.28 , rank-based intuitive bilingual evaluation score \( ribes \) 0.792097 , and adequacy-fluency metrics \( amfm \) score 0.830230 respectively.
