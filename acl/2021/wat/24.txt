IIIT Hyderabad Submission To WAT 2021: Efficient Multilingual NMT systems for Indian languages | Sourav Kumar | this paper describes the work and the systems submitted by the iiit-hyderbad team in the wat 2021 multiindicmt shared task. the task covers 10 major languages of the indian subcontinent. for the scope of this task , we have built multilingual systems for 20 translation directions namely english-indic \( one-to- many \) and indic-english \( many-to-one \) . individually , indian languages are resource poor which hampers translation quality but by leveraging multilingualism and abundant monolingual corpora , the translation quality can be substantially boosted. but the multilingual systems are highly complex in terms of time as well as computational resources. therefore , we are training our systems by efficiently se- lecting data that will actually contribute to most of the learning process. furthermore , we are also exploiting the language related- ness found in between indian languages. all the comparisons were made using bleu score and we found that our final multilingual sys- tem significantly outperforms the baselines by an average of 11.3 and 19.6 bleu points for english-indic \( en-xx \) and indic-english \( xx- en \) directions , respectively.
