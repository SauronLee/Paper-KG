IITP-MT at WAT2021: Indic-English Multilingual Neural Machine Translation using Romanized Vocabulary | Ramakrishna Appicharla | this paper describes the systems submitted to wat 2021 multiindicmt shared task by iitp-mt team. we submit two multilingual neural machine translation \( nmt \) systems \( indic-to-english and english-to-indic \) . we romanize all indic data and create subword vocabulary which is shared between all indic languages. we use back-translation approach to generate synthetic data which is appended to parallel corpus and used to train our models. the models are evaluated using bleu , ribes and amfm scores with indic-to-english model achieving 40.08 bleu for hindi-english pair and english-to-indic model achieving 34.48 bleu for english-hindi pair. however , we observe that the shared romanized subword vocabulary is not helping english-to-indic model at the time of generation , leading it to produce poor quality translations for tamil , telugu and malayalam to english pairs with bleu score of 8.51 , 6.25 and 3.79 respectively.
