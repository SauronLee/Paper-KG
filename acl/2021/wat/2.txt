Input Augmentation Improves Constrained Beam Search for Neural Machine Translation: NTT at WAT 2021 | Katsuki Chousa | this paper describes our systems that were submitted to the restricted translation task at wat 2021. in this task , the systems are required to output translated sentences that contain all given word constraints. our system combined input augmentation and constrained beam search algorithms. through experiments , we found that this combination significantly improves translation accuracy and can save inference time while containing all the constraints in the output. for both en->ja and ja->en , our systems obtained the best evaluation performances in automatic and human evaluation.
