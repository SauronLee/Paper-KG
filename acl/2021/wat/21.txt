Itihasa: A large-scale corpus for Sanskrit to English translation | Rahul Aralikatte | this work introduces itihasa , a large-scale translation dataset containing 93 , 000 pairs of sanskrit shlokas and their english translations. the shlokas are extracted from two indian epics viz. , the ramayana and the mahabharata. we first describe the motivation behind the curation of such a dataset and follow up with empirical analysis to bring out its nuances. we then benchmark the performance of standard translation models on this corpus and show that even state-of-the-art transformer architectures perform poorly , emphasizing the complexity of the dataset.
