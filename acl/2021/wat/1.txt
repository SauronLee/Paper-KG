NHKâ€™s Lexically-Constrained Neural Machine Translation at WAT 2021 | Hideya Mino | this paper describes the system of our team \( nhk \) for the wat 2021 japanese-english restricted machine translation task. in this task , the aim is to improve quality while maintaining consistent terminology for scientific paper translation. this task has a unique feature , where some words in a target sentence are given in addition to a source sentence. in this paper , we use a lexically-constrained neural machine translation \( nmt \) , which concatenates the source sentence and constrained words with a special token to input them into the encoder of nmt. the key to the successful lexically-constrained nmt is the way to extract constraints from a target sentence of training data. we propose two extraction methods: proper-noun constraint and mistranslated-word constraint. these two methods consider the importance of words and fallibility of nmt , respectively. the evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our lexical-constraint method.
