NECTECâ€™s Participation in WAT-2021 | Zar Zar Hlaing | in this paper , we report the experimental results of machine translation models conducted by a nectec team for the translation tasks of wat-2021. basically , our models are based on neural methods for both directions of english-myanmar and myanmar-english language pairs. most of the existing neural machine translation \( nmt \) models mainly focus on the conversion of sequential data and do not directly use syntactic information. however , we conduct multi-source neural machine translation \( nmt \) models using the multilingual corpora such as string data corpus , tree data corpus , or pos-tagged data corpus. the multi-source translation is an approach to exploit multiple inputs \( e.g. in two different formats \) to increase translation accuracy. the rnn-based encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism and transformer architectures have been carried out for our experiment. the experimental results showed that the proposed models of rnn-based architecture outperform the baseline model for english-to-myanmar translation task , and the multi-source and shared-multi-source transformer models yield better translation results than the baseline.
