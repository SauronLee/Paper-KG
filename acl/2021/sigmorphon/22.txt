Finite-state Model of Shupamem Reduplication | Magdalena Markowska | shupamem , a language of western cameroon , is a tonal language which also exhibits the morpho-phonological process of full reduplication. this creates two challenges for finite-state model of its morpho-syntax and morphophonology: how to manage the full reduplication and the autosegmental nature of lexical tone. dolatian and heinz \( 2020 \) explain how 2-way finite-state transducers can model full reduplication without an exponential increase in states , and finite-state transducers with multiple tapes have been used to model autosegmental tiers , including tone \( wiebe , 1992; dolatian and rawski , 2020a \) . here we synthesize 2-way finite-state transducers and multitape transducers , resulting in a finite-state formalism that subsumes both , to account for the full reduplicative processes in shupamem which also affect tone.
