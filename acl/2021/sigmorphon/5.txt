A Study of Morphological Robustness of Neural Machine Translation | Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi | in this work , we analyze the robustness of neural machine translation systems towards grammatical perturbations in the source. in particular , we focus on morphological inflection related perturbations. while this has been recently studied for english→french \( morpheus \) \( tan et al. , 2020 \) , it is unclear how this extends to any→english translation systems. we propose morpheus-multilingual that utilizes unimorph dictionaries to identify morphological perturbations to source that adversely affect the translation models. along with an analysis of state-of-the-art pretrained mt systems , we train and analyze systems for 11 language pairs using the multilingual ted corpus \( qi et al. , 2018 \) . we also compare this to actual errors of non-native speakers using grammatical error correction datasets. finally , we present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the robustness of any→english translation systems.
