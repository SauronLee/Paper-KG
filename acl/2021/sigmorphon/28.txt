Were We There Already? Applying Minimal Generalization to the SIGMORPHON-UniMorph Shared Task on Cognitively Plausible Morphological Inflection | Colin Wilson | morphological rules with various levels of specificity can be learned from example lexemes by recursive application of minimal generalization \( albright and hayes , 2002 , 2003 \) .a model that learns rules solely through minimal generalization was used to predict average human wug-test ratings from german , english , and dutch in the sigmorphon-unimorph 2021 shared task , with competitive results. some formal properties of the minimal generalization operation were proved. an automatic method was developed to create wug-test stimuli for future experiments that investigate whether the modelâ€™s morphological generalizations are too minimal.
