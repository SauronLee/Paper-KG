Recognizing Reduplicated Forms: Finite-State Buffered Machines | Yang Wang | total reduplication is common in natural language phonology and morphology. however , formally as copying on reduplicants of unbounded size , unrestricted total reduplication requires computational power beyond context-free , while other phonological and morphological patterns are regular , or even sub-regular. thus , existing language classes characterizing reduplicated strings inevitably include typologically unattested context-free patterns , such as reversals. this paper extends regular languages to incorporate reduplication by introducing a new computational device: finite state buffered machine \( fsbms \) . we give its mathematical definitions and discuss some closure properties of the corresponding set of languages. as a result , the class of regular languages and languages derived from them through a copying mechanism is characterized. suggested by previous literature , this class of languages should approach the characterization of natural language word sets.
