An FST morphological analyzer for the Gitksan language | Clarissa Forbes | this paper presents a finite-state morphological analyzer for the gitksan language. the analyzer draws from a 1250-token eastern dialect wordlist. it is based on finite-state technology and additionally includes two extensions which can provide analyses for out-of-vocabulary words: rules for generating predictable dialect variants , and a neural guesser component. the pre-neural analyzer , tested against interlinear-annotated texts from multiple dialects , achieves coverage of \( 75-81% \) , and maintains high precision \( 95-100% \) . the neural extension improves coverage at the cost of lowered precision.
