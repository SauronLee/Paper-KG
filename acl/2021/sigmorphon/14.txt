Linguistic Knowledge in Multilingual Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion | Roger Yu-Hsiang Lo | this paper documents the ubc linguistics teamâ€™s approach to the sigmorphon 2021 grapheme-to-phoneme shared task , concentrating on the low-resource setting. our systems expand the baseline model with simple modifications informed by syllable structure and error analysis. in-depth investigation of test-set predictions shows that our best model rectifies a significant number of mistakes compared to the baseline prediction , besting all other submissions. our results validate the view that careful error analysis in conjunction with linguistic knowledge can lead to more effective computational modeling.
