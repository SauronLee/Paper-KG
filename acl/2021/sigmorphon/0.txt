Towards Detection and Remediation of Phonemic Confusion | Francois Roewer-Despres | reducing communication breakdown is critical to success in interactive nlp applications , such as dialogue systems. to this end , we propose a confusion-mitigation framework for the detection and remediation of communication breakdown. in this work , as a first step towards implementing this framework , we focus on detecting phonemic sources of confusion. as a proof-of-concept , we evaluate two neural architectures in predicting the probability that a listener will misunderstand phonemes in an utterance. we show that both neural models outperform a weighted n-gram baseline , showing early promise for the broader framework.
