SIGMORPHON 2021 Shared Task on Morphological Reinflection: Generalization Across Languages | Tiago Pimentel | this year 's iteration of the sigmorphon shared task on morphological reinflection focuses on typological diversity and cross-lingual variation of morphosyntactic features. in terms of the task , we enrich unimorph with new data for 32 languages from 13 language families , with most of them being under-resourced: kunwinjku , classical syriac , arabic \( modern standard , egyptian , gulf \) , hebrew , amharic , aymara , magahi , braj , kurdish \( central , northern , southern \) , polish , karelian , livvi , ludic , veps , võro , evenki , xibe , tuvan , sakha , turkish , indonesian , kodi , seneca , asháninka , yanesha , chukchi , itelmen , eibela. we evaluate six systems on the new data and conduct an extensive error analysis of the systems' predictions. transformer-based models generally demonstrate superior performance on the majority of languages , achieving >90% accuracy on 65% of them. the languages on which systems yielded low accuracy are mainly under-resourced , with a limited amount of data. most errors made by the systems are due to allomorphy , honorificity , and form variation. in addition , we observe that systems especially struggle to inflect multiword lemmas. the systems also produce misspelled forms or end up in repetitive loops \( e.g. , rnn-based models \) . finally , we report a large drop in systems' performance on previously unseen lemmas.
