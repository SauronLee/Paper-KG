Paradigm Clustering with Weighted Edit Distance | Andrew Gerlach | this paper describes our system for the sigmorphon 2021 shared task on unsupervised morphological paradigm clustering , which asks participants to group inflected forms together according their underlying lemma without the aid of annotated training data. we employ agglomerative clustering to group word forms together using a metric that combines an orthographic distance and a semantic distance from word embeddings. we experiment with two variations of an edit distance-based model for quantifying orthographic distance , but , due to time constraints , our system does not improve over the shared taskâ€™s baseline system.
