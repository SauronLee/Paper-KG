Sample-efficient Linguistic Generalizations through Program Synthesis: Experiments with Phonology Problems | Saujas Vaduguru | neural models excel at extracting statistical patterns from large amounts of data , but struggle to learn patterns or reason about language from only a few examples. in this paper , we ask: can we learn explicit rules that generalize well from only a few examples \? we explore this question using program synthesis. we develop a synthesis model to learn phonology rules as programs in a domain-specific language. we test the ability of our models to generalize from few training examples using our new dataset of problems from the linguistics olympiad , a challenging set of tasks that require strong linguistic reasoning ability. in addition to being highly sample-efficient , our approach generates human-readable programs , and allows control over the generalizability of the learnt programs.
