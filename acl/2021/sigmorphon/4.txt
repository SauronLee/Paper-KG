MorphyNet: a Large Multilingual Database of Derivational and Inflectional Morphology | Khuyagbaatar Batsuren | large-scale morphological databases provide essential input to a wide range of nlp applications. inflectional data is of particular importance for morphologically rich \( agglutinative and highly inflecting \) languages , and derivations can be used , e.g. to infer the semantics of out-of-vocabulary words. extending the scope of state-of-the-art multilingual morphological databases , we announce the release of morphynet , a high-quality resource with 15 languages , 519k derivational and 10.1m inflectional entries , and a rich set of morphological features. morphynet was extracted from wiktionary using both hand-crafted and automated methods , and was manually evaluated to be of a precision higher than 98%. both the resource generation logic and the resulting database are made freely available and are reusable as stand-alone tools or in combination with existing resources.
