Orthographic vs. Semantic Representations for Unsupervised Morphological Paradigm Clustering | E. Margaret Perkoff | this paper presents two different systems for unsupervised clustering of morphological paradigms , in the context of the sigmorphon 2021 shared task 2. the goal of this task is to correctly cluster words in a given language by their inflectional paradigm , without any previous knowledge of the language and without supervision from labeled data of any sort. the words in a single morphological paradigm are different inflectional variants of an underlying lemma , meaning that the words share a common core meaning. they also - usually - show a high degree of orthographical similarity. following these intuitions , we investigate kmeans clustering using two different types of word representations: one focusing on orthographical similarity and the other focusing on semantic similarity.additionally , we discuss the merits of randomly initialized centroids versus pre-defined centroids for clustering. pre-defined centroids are identified based on either a standard longest common substring algorithm or a connected graph method built off of longest common substring. for all development languages , the character-based embeddings perform similarly to the baseline , and the semantic embeddings perform well below the baseline.analysis of the systemsâ€™ errors suggests that clustering based on orthographic representations is suitable for a wide range of morphological mechanisms , particularly as part of a larger system.
