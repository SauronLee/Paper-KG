Findings of the SIGMORPHON 2021 Shared Task on Unsupervised Morphological Paradigm Clustering | Adam Wiemerslage | we describe the second sigmorphon shared task on unsupervised morphology: the goal of the sigmorphon 2021 shared task on unsupervised morphological paradigm clustering is to cluster word types from a raw text corpus into paradigms. to this end , we release corpora for 5 development and 9 test languages , as well as gold partial paradigms for evaluation. we receive 14 submissions from 4 teams that follow different strategies , and the best performing system is based on adaptor grammars. results vary significantly across languages. however , all systems are outperformed by a supervised lemmatizer , implying that there is still room for improvement.
