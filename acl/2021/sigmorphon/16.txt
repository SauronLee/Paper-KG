CLUZH at SIGMORPHON 2021 Shared Task on Multilingual Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion: Variations on a Baseline | Simon Clematide | this paper describes the submission by the team from the department of computational linguistics , zurich university , to the multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion \( g2p \) task 1 of the sigmorphon 2021 challenge in the low and medium settings. the submission is a variation of our 2020 g2p system , which serves as the baseline for this yearâ€™s challenge. the system is a neural transducer that operates over explicit edit actions and is trained with imitation learning. for this challenge , we experimented with the following changes: a \) emitting phoneme segments instead of single character phonemes , b \) input character dropout , c \) a mogrifier lstm decoder \( melis et al. , 2019 \) , d \) enriching the decoder input with the currently attended input character , e \) parallel bilstm encoders , and f \) an adaptive batch size scheduler. in the low setting , our best ensemble improved over the baseline , however , in the medium setting , the baseline was stronger on average , although for certain languages improvements could be observed.
