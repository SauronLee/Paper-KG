Recursive prosody is not finite-state | Hossep Dolatian | this paper investigates bounds on the generative capacity of prosodic processes , by focusing on the complexity of recursive prosody in coordination contexts in english \( wagner , 2010 \) . although all phonological processes and most prosodic processes are computationally regular string languages , we show that recursive prosody is not. the output string language is instead parallel multiple context-free \( seki et al. , 1991 \) . we evaluate the complexity of the pattern over strings , and then move on to a characterization over trees that requires the expressivity of multi bottom-up tree transducers. in doing so , we provide a foundation for future mathematically grounded investigations of the syntax-prosody interface.
