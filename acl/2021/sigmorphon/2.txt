The Match-Extend serialization algorithm in Multiprecedence | Maxime Papillon | raimy \( 1999; 2000a; 2000b \) proposed a graphical formalism for modeling reduplication , originallymostly focused on phonological overapplication in a derivational framework. this framework is now known as precedence-based phonology or multiprecedence phonology. raimy’s idea is that the segments at the input to the phonology are not totally ordered by precedence. this paper tackles a challenge that arose with raimy’s work , the development of a deterministic serialization algorithm as part of the derivation of surface forms. the match-extend algorithm introduced here requires fewer assumptions and sticks tighter to the attested typology. the algorithm also contains no parameter or constraint specific to individual graphs or topologies , unlike previous proposals. match-extend requires nothing except knowing the last added set of links.
