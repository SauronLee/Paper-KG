Developing a How-to Tip Machine Comprehension Dataset and its Evaluation in Machine Comprehension by BERT | Tengyang Chen | in the field of factoid question answering \( qa \) , it is known that the state-of-the-art technology has achieved an accuracy comparable to that of humans in a certain benchmark challenge. on the other hand , in the area of non-factoid qa , there is still a limited number of datasets for training qa models , i.e. , machine comprehension models. considering such a situation within the field of the non-factoid qa , this paper aims to develop a dataset for training japanese how-to tip qa models. this paper applies one of the state-of-the-art machine comprehension models to the japanese how-to tip qa dataset. the trained how-to tip qa model is also compared with a factoid qa model trained with a japanese factoid qa dataset. evaluation results revealed that the how-to tip machine comprehension performance was almost comparative with that of the factoid machine comprehension even with the training data size reduced to around 4% of the factoid machine comprehension. thus , the how-to tip machine comprehension task requires much less training data compared with the factoid machine comprehension task.
