A Probabilistic Model with Commonsense Constraints for Pattern-based Temporal Fact Extraction | Yang Zhou | textual patterns \( e.g. , countryâ€™s president person \) are specified and/or generated for extracting factual information from unstructured data. pattern-based information extraction methods have been recognized for their efficiency and transferability. however , not every pattern is reliable: a major challenge is to derive the most complete and accurate facts from diverse and sometimes conflicting extractions. in this work , we propose a probabilistic graphical model which formulates fact extraction in a generative process. it automatically infers true facts and pattern reliability without any supervision. it has two novel designs specially for temporal facts: \( 1 \) it models pattern reliability on two types of time signals , including temporal tag in text and text generation time; \( 2 \) it models commonsense constraints as observable variables. experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods on extracting true temporal facts from news data.
