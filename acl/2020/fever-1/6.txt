Distilling the Evidence to Augment Fact Verification Models | Beatrice Portelli | the alarming spread of fake news in social media , together with the impossibility of scaling manual fact verification , motivated the development of natural language processing techniques to automatically verify the veracity of claims. most approaches perform a claim-evidence classification without providing any insights about why the claim is trustworthy or not. we propose , instead , a model-agnostic framework that consists of two modules: \( 1 \) a span extractor , which identifies the crucial information connecting claim and evidence; and \( 2 \) a classifier that combines claim , evidence , and the extracted spans to predict the veracity of the claim. we show that the spans are informative for the classifier , improving performance and robustness. tested on several state-of-the-art models over the fever dataset , the enhanced classifiers consistently achieve higher accuracy while also showing reduced sensitivity to artifacts in the claims.
