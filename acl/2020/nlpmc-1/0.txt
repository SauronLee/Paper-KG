Methods for Extracting Information from Messages from Primary Care Providers to Specialists | Xiyu Ding | electronic consult \( econsult \) systems allow specialists more flexibility to respond to referrals more efficiently , thereby increasing access in under-resourced healthcare settings like safety net systems. understanding the usage patterns of econsult system is an important part of improving specialist efficiency. in this work , we develop and apply classifiers to a dataset of econsult questions from primary care providers to specialists , classifying the messages for how they were triaged by the specialist office , and the underlying type of clinical question posed by the primary care provider. we show that pre-trained transformer models are strong baselines , with improving performance from domain-specific training and shared representations.
