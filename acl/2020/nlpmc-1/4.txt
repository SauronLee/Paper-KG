Towards an Ontology-based Medication Conversational Agent for PrEP and PEP | Muhammad Amith | abstract: hiv \( human immunodeficiency virus \) can damage a humanâ€™s immune system and cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \( aids \) which could lead to severe outcomes , including death. while hiv infections have decreased over the last decade , there is still a significant population where the infection permeates. prep and pep are two proven preventive measures introduced that involve periodic dosage to stop the onset of hiv infection. however , the adherence rates for this medication is low in part due to the lack of information about the medication. there exist several communication barriers that prevent patient-provider communication from happening. in this work , we present our ontology-based method for automating the communication of this medication that can be deployed for live conversational agents for prep and pep. this method facilitates a model of automated conversation between the machine and user can also answer relevant questions.
