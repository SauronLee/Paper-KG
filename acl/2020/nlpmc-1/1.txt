Towards Understanding ASR Error Correction for Medical Conversations | Anirudh Mani | domain adaptation for automatic speech recognition \( asr \) error correction via machine translation is a useful technique for improving out-of-domain outputs of pre-trained asr systems to obtain optimal results for specific in-domain tasks. we use this technique on our dataset of doctor-patient conversations using two off-the-shelf asr systems: google asr \( commercial \) and the aspire model \( open-source \) . we train a sequence-to-sequence machine translation model and evaluate it on seven specific umls semantic types , including pharmacological substance , sign or symptom , and diagnostic procedure to name a few. lastly , we breakdown , analyze and discuss the 7% overall improvement in word error rate in view of each semantic type.
