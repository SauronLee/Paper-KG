Topic-Based Measures of Conversation for Detecting Mild CognitiveImpairment | Meysam Asgari | conversation is a complex cognitive task that engages multiple aspects of cognitive functions to remember the discussed topics , monitor the semantic and linguistic elements , and recognize othersâ€™ emotions. in this paper , we propose a computational method based on the lexical coherence of consecutive utterances to quantify topical variations in semi-structured conversations of older adults with cognitive impairments. extracting the lexical knowledge of conversational utterances , our method generate a set of novel conversational measures that indicate underlying cognitive deficits among subjects with mild cognitive impairment \( mci \) . our preliminary results verifies the utility of the proposed conversation-based measures in distinguishing mci from healthy controls.
