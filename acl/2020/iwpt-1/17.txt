Hybrid Enhanced Universal Dependencies Parsing | Johannes Heinecke | this paper describes our system to predict enhanced dependencies for universal dependencies \( ud \) treebanks , which ranked 2nd in the shared task on enhanced dependency parsing with an average elas of 82.60%. our system uses a hybrid two-step approach. first , we use a graph-based parser to extract a basic syntactic dependency tree. then , we use a set of linguistic rules which generate the enhanced dependencies for the syntactic tree. the application of these rules is optimized using a classifier which predicts their suitability in the given context. a key advantage of this approach is its language independence , as rules rely solely on dependency trees and upos tags which are shared across all languages.
