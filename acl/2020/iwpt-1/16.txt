Turku Enhanced Parser Pipeline: From Raw Text to Enhanced Graphs in the IWPT 2020 Shared Task | Jenna Kanerva | we present the approach of the turkunlp group to the iwpt 2020 shared task on multilingual parsing into enhanced universal dependencies. the task involves 28 treebanks in 17 different languages and requires parsers to generate graph structures extending on the basic dependency trees. our approach combines language-specific bert models , the udify parser , neural sequence-to-sequence lemmatization and a graph transformation approach encoding the enhanced structure into a dependency tree. our submission averaged 84.5% elas , ranking first in the shared task. we make all methods and resources developed for this study freely available under open licenses from https://turkunlp.org.
