Køpsala: Transition-Based Graph Parsing via Efficient Training and Effective Encoding | Daniel Hershcovich | we present køpsala , the copenhagen-uppsala system for the enhanced universal dependencies shared task at iwpt 2020. our system is a pipeline consisting of off-the-shelf models for everything but enhanced graph parsing , and for the latter , a transition-based graph parser adapted from che et al. \( 2019 \) . we train a single enhanced parser model per language , using gold sentence splitting and tokenization for training , and rely only on tokenized surface forms and multilingual bert for encoding. while a bug introduced just before submission resulted in a severe drop in precision , its post-submission fix would bring us to 4th place in the official ranking , according to average elas. our parser demonstrates that a unified pipeline is effective for both meaning representation parsing and enhanced universal dependencies.
