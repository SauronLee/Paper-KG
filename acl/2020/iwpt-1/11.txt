Span-Based LCFRS-2 Parsing | Miloš Stanojević | the earliest models for discontinuous constituency parsers used mildly context-sensitive grammars , but the fashion has changed in recent years to grammar-less transition-based parsers that use strong neural probabilistic models to greedily predict transitions. we argue that grammar-based approaches still have something to contribute on top of what is offered by transition-based parsers. concretely , by using a grammar formalism to restrict the space of possible trees we can use dynamic programming parsing algorithms for exact search for the most probable tree. previous chart-based parsers for discontinuous formalisms used probabilistically weak generative models. we instead use a span-based discriminative neural model that preserves the dynamic programming properties of the chart parsers. our parser does not use an explicit grammar , but it does use explicit grammar formalism constraints: we generate only trees that are within the lcfrs-2 formalism. these properties allow us to construct a new parsing algorithm that runs in lower worst-case time complexity of o \( l nˆ4 +nˆ6 \) , where
