RobertNLP at the IWPT 2020 Shared Task: Surprisingly Simple Enhanced UD Parsing for English | Stefan Gr√ºnewald | this paper presents our system at the iwpt 2020 shared task on parsing into enhanced universal dependencies. using a biaffine classifier architecture \( dozat and manning , 2017 \) which operates directly on finetuned roberta embeddings , our parser generates enhanced ud graphs by predicting the best dependency label \( or absence of a dependency \) for each pair of tokens in the sentence. we address label sparsity issues by replacing lexical items in relations with placeholders at prediction time , later retrieving them from the parse in a rule-based fashion. in addition , we ensure structural graph constraints using a simple set of heuristics. on the english blind test data , our system achieves a very high parsing accuracy , ranking 1st out of 10 with an elas f1 score of 88.94%.
