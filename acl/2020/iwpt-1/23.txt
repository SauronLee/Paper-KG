The ADAPT Enhanced Dependency Parser at the IWPT 2020 Shared Task | James Barry | we describe the adapt system for the 2020 iwpt shared task on parsing enhanced universal dependencies in 17 languages. we implement a pipeline approach using udpipe and udpipe-future to provide initial levels of annotation. the enhanced dependency graph is either produced by a graph-based semantic dependency parser or is built from the basic tree using a small set of heuristics. our results show that , for the majority of languages , a semantic dependency parser can be successfully applied to the task of parsing enhanced dependencies. unfortunately , we did not ensure a connected graph as part of our pipeline approach and our competition submission relied on a last-minute fix to pass the validation script which harmed our official evaluation scores significantly. our submission ranked eighth in the official evaluation with a macro-averaged coarse elas f1 of 67.23 and a treebank average of 67.49. we later implemented our own graph-connecting fix which resulted in a score of 79.53 \( language average \) or 79.76 \( treebank average \) , which would have placed fourth in the competition evaluation.
