Tensors over Semirings for Latent-Variable Weighted Logic Programs | Esma Balkir | semiring parsing is an elegant framework for describing parsers by using semiring weighted logic programs. in this paper we present a generalization of this concept: latent-variable semiring parsing. with our framework , any semiring weighted logic program can be latentified by transforming weights from scalar values of a semiring to rank-n arrays , or tensors , of semiring values , allowing the modelling of latent-variable models within the semiring parsing framework. semiring is too strong a notion when dealing with tensors , and we have to resort to a weaker structure: a partial semiring. we prove that this generalization preserves all the desired properties of the original semiring framework while strictly increasing its expressiveness.
