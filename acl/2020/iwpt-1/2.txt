End-to-End Negation Resolution as Graph Parsing | Robin Kurtz | we present a neural end-to-end architecture for negation resolution based on a formulation of the task as a graph parsing problem. our approach allows for the straightforward inclusion of many types of graph-structured features without the need for representation-specific heuristics. in our experiments , we specifically gauge the usefulness of syntactic information for negation resolution. despite the conceptual simplicity of our architecture , we achieve state-of-the-art results on the conan doyle benchmark dataset , including a new top result for our best model.
