How Much of Enhanced UD Is Contained in UD? | Adam Ek | in this paper , we present the submission of team clasp to the iwpt 2020 shared task on parsing enhanced universal dependencies. we develop a tree-to-graph transformation algorithm based on dependency patterns. this algorithm can transform gold ud trees to eud graphs with an elas score of 81.55 and a eulas score of 96.70. these results show that much of the information needed to construct eud graphs from ud trees are present in the ud trees. coupled with a standard ud parser , the method applies to the official test data and yields and elas score of 67.85 and a eulas score is 80.18.
