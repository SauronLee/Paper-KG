The Importance of Category Labels in Grammar Induction with Child-directed Utterances | Lifeng Jin | recent progress in grammar induction has shown that grammar induction is possible without explicit assumptions of language specific knowledge. however , evaluation of induced grammars usually has ignored phrasal labels , an essential part of a grammar. experiments in this work using a labeled evaluation metric , rh , show that linguistically motivated predictions about grammar sparsity and use of categories can only be revealed through labeled evaluation. furthermore , depth-bounding as an implementation of human memory constraints in grammar inducers is still effective with labeled evaluation on multilingual transcribed child-directed utterances.
