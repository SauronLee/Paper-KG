Linear Neural Parsing and Hybrid Enhancement for Enhanced Universal Dependencies | Giuseppe Attardi | to accomplish the shared task on dependency parsing we explore the use of a linear transition-based neural dependency parser as well as a combination of three of them by means of a linear tree combination algorithm. we train separate models for each language on the shared task data. we compare our base parser with two biaffine parsers and also present an ensemble combination of all five parsers , which achieves an average uas 1.88 point lower than the top official submission. for producing the enhanced dependencies , we exploit a hybrid approach , coupling an algorithmic graph transformation of the dependency tree with predictions made by a multitask machine learning model.
