Statistical Deep Parsing for Spanish Using Neural Networks | Luis Chiruzzo | this paper presents the development of a deep parser for spanish that uses a hpsg grammar and returns trees that contain both syntactic and semantic information. the parsing process uses a top-down approach implemented using lstm neural networks , and achieves good performance results in terms of syntactic constituency and dependency metrics , and also srl. we describe the grammar , corpus and implementation of the parser. our process outperforms a cky baseline and other spanish parsers in terms of global metrics and also for some specific spanish phenomena , such as clitics reduplication and relative referents.
