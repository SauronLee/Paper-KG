A Comparison of Identification Methods of Brazilian Music Styles by Lyrics | Patrick Guimar√£es | predicting the degree of compositionality of noun compounds is a crucial ingredient for lexicography and nlp applications , to know whether the compound should be treated as a whole , or through its constituents. computational approaches for an automatic prediction typically represent compounds and their constituents within a vector space to have a numeric relatedness measure for the words. this paper provides a systematic evaluation of using different vector-space reduction variants for the prediction. we demonstrate that word2vec and nouns-only dimensionality reductions are the most successful and stable vector space reduction variants for our task.
