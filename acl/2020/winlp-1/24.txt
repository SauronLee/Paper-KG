The human unlikeness of neural language models in next-word prediction | Cassandra L. Jacobs | gender bias negatively impacts many natural language processing applications , including machine translation \( mt \) . the motivation behind this work is to study whether recent proposed mt techniques are significantly contributing to attenuate biases in document-level and gender-balanced data. for the study , we consider approaches of adding the previous sentence and the speaker information , implemented in a decoder-based neural mt system. we show improvements both in translation quality \( +1 bleu point \) as well as in gender bias mitigation on winomt \( +5% accuracy \) .
