Analyzing the Framing of 2020 Presidential Candidates in the News | Audrey Acken | our work focuses on the biases that emerge in the natural language generation \( nlg \) task of sentence completion. in this paper , we introduce a mathematical framework of fairness for nlg followed by an evaluation of gender biases in two state-of-the-art language models. our analysis provides a theoretical formulation for biases in nlg and empirical evidence that existing language generation models embed gender bias.
