An Evaluation of Subword Segmentation Strategies for Neural Machine Translation of Morphologically Rich Languages | Aquia Richburg | the assignment of icd-10 codes is done manually , which is laborious and prone to errors. the use of natural language processing and machine learning approaches have been receiving increasing attention on automating the task of assigning icd-10 codes. in this study , we investigate the effect of different approaches on automating the task of assigning icd-10 codes. to do this we use the south african clinical dataset containing three narrative text fields \( clinical summary , presenting complaints , and examination findings \) . the following traditional machine learning algorithms , namely: logistic regression , multinomial naive bayes , support vector machine , decision tree , randomforest , and extreme gradient boost were used as our classifiers. our study results show the strong potential of automated icd-10 coding from the narrative text fields. extremegradient boost outperformed other classifiers in automating the task of assigning icd-10 codes based on the three narrative text fields with an accuracy of 79% , precision of75% , and recall of 78%. while our worst classifier \( decision tree \) achieved the accuracy of 54% , precision of 60% and recall of 56%.
