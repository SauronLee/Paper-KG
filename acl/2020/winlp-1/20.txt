Towards Mitigating Gender Bias in a decoder-based Neural Machine Translation model by Adding Contextual Information | Christine Basta | all over the world and especially in africa , researchers are putting efforts into building neural machine translation \( nmt \) systems to help tackle the language barriers in africa , a continent of over 2000 different languages. however , the low-resourceness , diacritical , and tonal complexities of african languages are major issues being faced. the ffr project is a major step towards creating a robust translation model from fon , a very low-resource and tonal language , to french , for research and public use. in this paper , we introduce ffr dataset , a corpus of fon-to-french translations , describe the diacritical encoding process , and introduce our ffr v1.1 model , trained on the dataset. the dataset and model are made publicly available , to promote collaboration and reproducibility.
