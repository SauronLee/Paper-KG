Studying The Effect of Emotional and Moral Language on Information Contagion during the Charlottesville Event | Khyati Mahajan | the training objective of unidirectional language models \( lms \) is similar to a psycholinguistic benchmark known as the cloze task , which measures next-word predictability. however , lms lack the rich set of experiences that people do , and humans can be highly creative. to assess human parity in these modelsâ€™ training objective , we compare the predictions of three neural language models to those of human participants in a freely available behavioral dataset \( luke & christianson , 2016 \) . our results show that while neural models show a close correspondence to human productions , they nevertheless assign insufficient probability to how often speakers guess upcoming words , especially for open-class content words.
