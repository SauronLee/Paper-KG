SIMPLEX-PB 2.0: A Reliable Dataset for Lexical Simplification in Brazilian Portuguese | Nathan Hartmann | most research on lexical simplification \( ls \) addresses non-native speakers of english , since they are numerous and easy to recruit. this makes it difficult to create ls solutions for other languages and target audiences. this paper presents simplex-pb 2.0 , a dataset for ls in brazilian portuguese that , unlike its predecessor simplex-pb , accurately captures the needs of brazilian underprivileged children. to create simplex-pb 2.0 , we addressed all limitations of the old simplex-pb through multiple rounds of manual annotation. as a result , simplex-pb 2.0 features much more reliable and numerous candidate substitutions to complex words , as well as word complexity rankings produced by a group underprivileged children.
