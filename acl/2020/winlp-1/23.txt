Political Advertising Dataset: the use case of the Polish 2020 Presidential Elections | Lukasz Augustyniak | we propose a multi-head attention mechanism as a blending layer in a neural network model that translates natural language to a high level behavioral language for indoor robot navigation. we follow the framework established by \( zang et al. , 2018a \) that proposes the use of a navigation graph as a knowledge base for the task. our results show significant performance gains when translating instructions on previously unseen environments , therefore , improving the generalization capabilities of the model.
