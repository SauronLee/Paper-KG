FFR v1.1: Fon-French Neural Machine Translation | Chris Chinenye Emezue | simplified languages are instruments for inclusion aiming to overcome language barriers. leichte sprache \( ls \) , for instance , is a variety of german with reduced complexity \( cf. basic english \) . so far , ls is mainly provided for , but rarely written by , its target groups , e.g. people with cognitive impairments. one reason may be the lack of technical support during the process from message conceptualization to sentence realization. in the following , we present a system for assisted typing in ls whose accuracy and speed is largely due to the deployment of real time natural-language processing enabling efficient prediction and context-sensitive grammar support.
