COVID-19 and Arabic Twitter: How can Arab World Governments and Public Health Organizations Learn from Social Media? | Lama Alsudias | in march 2020 , the world health organization announced the covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic. most previous social media related research has been on english tweets and covid-19. in this study , we collect approximately 1 million arabic tweets from the twitter streaming api related to covid-19. focussing on outcomes that we believe will be useful for public health organizations , we analyse them in three different ways: identifying the topics discussed during the period , detecting rumours , and predicting the source of the tweets. we use the k-means algorithm for the first goal with k=5. the topics discussed can be grouped as follows: covid-19 statistics , prayers for god , covid-19 locations , advise and education for prevention , and advertising. we sample 2000 tweets and label them manually for false information , correct information , and unrelated. then , we apply three different machine learning algorithms , logistic regression , support vector classification , and na√Øve bayes with two sets of features , word frequency approach and word embeddings. we find that machine learning classifiers are able to correctly identify the rumour related tweets with 84% accuracy. we also try to predict the source of the rumour related tweets depending on our previous model which is about classifying tweets into five categories: academic , media , government , health professional , and public. around \( 60% \) of the rumour related tweets are classified as written by health professionals and academics.
