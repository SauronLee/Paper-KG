CORD-19: The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset | Lucy Lu Wang | the covid-19 open research dataset \( cord-19 \) is a growing resource of scientific papers on covid-19 and related historical coronavirus research. cord-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and information retrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and structured full text papers. since its release , cord-19 has been downloaded over 200k times and has served as the basis of many covid-19 text mining and discovery systems. in this article , we describe the mechanics of dataset construction , highlighting challenges and key design decisions , provide an overview of how cord-19 has been used , and describe several shared tasks built around the dataset. we hope this resource will continue to bring together the computing community , biomedical experts , and policy makers in the search for effective treatments and management policies for covid-19.
