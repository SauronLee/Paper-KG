Cross-language sentiment analysis of European Twitter messages during the COVID-19 pandemic | Anna Kruspe | in this paper , we analyze twitter messages \( tweets \) collected during the first months of the covid-19 pandemic in europe with regard to their sentiment. this is implemented with a neural network for sentiment analysis using multilingual sentence embeddings. we separate the results by country of origin , and correlate their temporal development with events in those countries. this allows us to study the effect of the situation on peopleâ€™s moods. we see , for example , that lockdown announcements correlate with a deterioration of mood in almost all surveyed countries , which recovers within a short time span.
