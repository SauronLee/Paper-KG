Self-supervised context-aware COVID-19 document exploration through atlas grounding | Dusan Grujicic | in this paper , we aim to develop a self-supervised grounding of covid-related medical text based on the actual spatial relationships between the referred anatomical concepts. more specifically , we learn to project sentences into a physical space defined by a three-dimensional anatomical atlas , allowing for a visual approach to navigating covid-related literature. we design a straightforward and empirically effective training objective to reduce the curated data dependency issue. we use bert as the main building block of our model and perform a quantitative analysis that demonstrates that the model learns a context-aware mapping. we illustrate two potential use-cases for our approach , one in interactive , 3d data exploration , and the other in document retrieval. to accelerate research in this direction , we make public all trained models , codebase and the developed tools , which can be accessed at https://github.com/gorjanradevski/macchina/.
