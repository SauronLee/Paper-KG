Measuring Emotions in the COVID-19 Real World Worry Dataset | Bennett Kleinberg | the covid-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on societies and economies around the world. with various measures of lockdowns and social distancing in place , it becomes important to understand emotional responses on a large scale. in this paper , we present the first ground truth dataset of emotional responses to covid-19. we asked participants to indicate their emotions and express these in text. this resulted in the real world worry dataset of 5 , 000 texts \( 2 , 500 short + 2 , 500 long texts \) . our analyses suggest that emotional responses correlated with linguistic measures. topic modeling further revealed that people in the uk worry about their family and the economic situation. tweet-sized texts functioned as a call for solidarity , while longer texts shed light on worries and concerns. using predictive modeling approaches , we were able to approximate the emotional responses of participants from text within 14% of their actual value. we encourage others to use the dataset and improve how we can use automated methods to learn about emotional responses and worries about an urgent problem.
