Personalized PageRank with Syntagmatic Information for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation | Federico Scozzafava | exploiting syntagmatic information is an encouraging research focus to be pursued in an effort to close the gap between knowledge-based and supervised word sense disambiguation \( wsd \) performance. we follow this direction in our next-generation knowledge-based wsd system , syntagrank , which we make available via a web interface and a restful api. syntagrank leverages the disambiguated pairs of co-occurring words included in syntagnet , a lexical-semantic combination resource , to perform state-of-the-art knowledge-based wsd in a multilingual setting. our service provides both a user-friendly interface , available at http://syntagnet.org/ , and a restful endpoint to query the system programmatically \( accessible at http://api.syntagnet.org/ \) .
