Stanza: A Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Many Human Languages | Peng Qi | we introduce stanza , an open-source python natural language processing toolkit supporting 66 human languages. compared to existing widely used toolkits , stanza features a language-agnostic fully neural pipeline for text analysis , including tokenization , multi-word token expansion , lemmatization , part-of-speech and morphological feature tagging , dependency parsing , and named entity recognition. we have trained stanza on a total of 112 datasets , including the universal dependencies treebanks and other multilingual corpora , and show that the same neural architecture generalizes well and achieves competitive performance on all languages tested. additionally , stanza includes a native python interface to the widely used java stanford corenlp software , which further extends its functionality to cover other tasks such as coreference resolution and relation extraction. source code , documentation , and pretrained models for 66 languages are available at https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/.
