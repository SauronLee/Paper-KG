SyntaxGym: An Online Platform for Targeted Evaluation of Language Models | Jon Gauthier | targeted syntactic evaluations have yielded insights into the generalizations learned by neural network language models. however , this line of research requires an uncommon confluence of skills: both the theoretical knowledge needed to design controlled psycholinguistic experiments , and the technical proficiency needed to train and deploy large-scale language models. we present syntaxgym , an online platform designed to make targeted evaluations accessible to both experts in nlp and linguistics , reproducible across computing environments , and standardized following the norms of psycholinguistic experimental design. this paper releases two tools of independent value for the computational linguistics community: 1. a website , syntaxgym.org , which centralizes the process of targeted syntactic evaluation and provides easy tools for analysis and visualization; 2. two command-line tools , ‘syntaxgym‘ and ‘lm-zoo‘ , which allow any user to reproduce targeted syntactic evaluations and general language model inference on their own machine.
