LinggleWrite: a Coaching System for Essay Writing | Chung-Ting Tsai | this paper presents lingglewrite , a writing coach that provides writing suggestions , assesses writing proficiency levels , detects grammatical errors , and offers corrective feedback in response to userâ€™s essay. the method involves extracting grammar patterns , training models for automated essay scoring \( aes \) and grammatical error detection \( ged \) , and finally retrieving plausible corrections from a n-gram search engine. experiments on public test sets indicate that both aes and ged models achieve state-of-the-art performance. these results show that lingglewrite is potentially useful in helping learners improve their writing skills.
