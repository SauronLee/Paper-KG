ESPnet-ST: All-in-One Speech Translation Toolkit | Hirofumi Inaguma | we present espnet-st , which is designed for the quick development of speech-to-speech translation systems in a single framework. espnet-st is a new project inside end-to-end speech processing toolkit , espnet , which integrates or newly implements automatic speech recognition , machine translation , and text-to-speech functions for speech translation. we provide all-in-one recipes including data pre-processing , feature extraction , training , and decoding pipelines for a wide range of benchmark datasets. our reproducible results can match or even outperform the current state-of-the-art performances; these pre-trained models are downloadable. the toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/espnet/espnet.
