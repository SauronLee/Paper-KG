LEAN-LIFE: A Label-Efficient Annotation Framework Towards Learning from Explanation | Dong-Ho Lee | successfully training a deep neural network demands a huge corpus of labeled data. however , each label only provides limited information to learn from , and collecting the requisite number of labels involves massive human effort. in this work , we introduce lean-life , a web-based , label-efficient annotation framework for sequence labeling and classification tasks , with an easy-to-use ui that not only allows an annotator to provide the needed labels for a task but also enables learning from explanations for each labeling decision. such explanations enable us to generate useful additional labeled data from unlabeled instances , bolstering the pool of available training data. on three popular nlp tasks \( named entity recognition , relation extraction , sentiment analysis \) , we find that using this enhanced supervision allows our models to surpass competitive baseline f1 scores by more than 5-10 percentage points , while using 2x times fewer labeled instances. our framework is the first to utilize this enhanced supervision technique and does so for three important tasks â€“ thus providing improved annotation recommendations to users and an ability to build datasets of \( data , label , explanation \) triples instead of the regular \( data , label \) pair.
