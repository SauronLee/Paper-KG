Photon: A Robust Cross-Domain Text-to-SQL System | Jichuan Zeng | natural language interfaces to databases \( nlidb \) democratize end user access to relational data. due to fundamental differences between natural language communication and programming , it is common for end users to issue questions that are ambiguous to the system or fall outside the semantic scope of its underlying query language. we present photon , a robust , modular , cross-domain nlidb that can flag natural language input to which a sql mapping cannot be immediately determined. photon consists of a strong neural semantic parser \( 63.2% structure accuracy on the spider dev benchmark \) , a human-in-the-loop question corrector , a sql executor and a response generator. the question corrector isa discriminative neural sequence editor which detects confusion span \( s \) in the input question and suggests rephrasing until a translatable input is given by the user or a maximum number of iterations are conducted. experiments on simulated data show that the proposed method effectively improves the robustness of text-to-sql system against untranslatable user input.the live demo of our system is available at http://www.naturalsql.com
