Penman: An Open-Source Library and Tool for AMR Graphs | Michael Wayne Goodman | abstract meaning representation \( amr \) \( banarescu et al. , 2013 \) is a framework for semantic dependencies that encodes its rooted and directed acyclic graphs in a format called penman notation. the format is simple enough that users of amr data often write small scripts or libraries for parsing it into an internal graph representation , but there is enough complexity that these users could benefit from a more sophisticated and well-tested solution. the open-source python library penman provides a robust parser , functions for graph inspection and manipulation , and functions for formatting graphs into penman notation. many functions are also available in a command-line tool , thus extending its utility to non-python setups.
