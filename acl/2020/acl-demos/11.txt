Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder for Semantic Retrieval | Yinfei Yang | we present easy-to-use retrieval focused multilingual sentence embedding models , made available on tensorflow hub. the models embed text from 16 languages into a shared semantic space using a multi-task trained dual-encoder that learns tied cross-lingual representations via translation bridge tasks \( chidambaram et al. , 2018 \) . the models achieve a new state-of-the-art in performance on monolingual and cross-lingual semantic retrieval \( sr \) . competitive performance is obtained on the related tasks of translation pair bitext retrieval \( br \) and retrieval question answering \( reqa \) . on transfer learning tasks , our multilingual embeddings approach , and in some cases exceed , the performance of english only sentence embeddings.
