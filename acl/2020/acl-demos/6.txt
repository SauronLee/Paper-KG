pyBART: Evidence-based Syntactic Transformations for IE | Aryeh Tiktinsky | syntactic dependencies can be predicted with high accuracy , and are useful for both machine-learned and pattern-based information extraction tasks. however , their utility can be improved. these syntactic dependencies are designed to accurately reflect syntactic relations , and they do not make semantic relations explicit. therefore , these representations lack many explicit connections between content words , that would be useful for downstream applications. proposals like english enhanced ud improve the situation by extending universal dependency trees with additional explicit arcs. however , they are not available to python users , and are also limited in coverage. we introduce a broad-coverage , data-driven and linguistically sound set of transformations , that makes event-structure and many lexical relations explicit. we present pybart , an easy-to-use open-source python library for converting english ud trees either to enhanced ud graphs or to our representation. the library can work as a standalone package or be integrated within a spacy nlp pipeline. when evaluated in a pattern-based relation extraction scenario , our representation results in higher extraction scores than enhanced ud , while requiring fewer patterns.
