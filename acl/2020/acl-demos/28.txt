Usnea: An Authorship Tool for Interactive Fiction using Retrieval Based Semantic Parsing | Ben Swanson | the reader of a choose your own adventure novel and the user of a modern virtual assistant have a subtle similarity; both may , through the right lens , be viewed as engaging with a work of interactive fiction. this literary form emerged in the 1970s and has grown like a vine along the branch of modern technology , one guided by the advances of the other. in this work we weave together threads from the interactive fiction community and neural semantic parsing for dialog systems , defining the data model and necessary algorithms for a novel type of interactive fiction and open sourcing its accompanying authoring tool. specifically , our work integrates retrieval based semantic parsing predicates into the branching story structures well known to the interactive fiction community , relaxing the relatively strict lexical options of preexisting systems.
