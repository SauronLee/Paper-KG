BENTO: A Visual Platform for Building Clinical NLP Pipelines Based on CodaLab | Yonghao Jin | codalab is an open-source web-based platform for collaborative computational research. although codalab has gained popularity in the research community , its interface has limited support for creating reusable tools that can be easily applied to new datasets and composed into pipelines. in clinical domain , natural language processing \( nlp \) on medical notes generally involves multiple steps , like tokenization , named entity recognition , etc. since these steps require different tools which are usually scattered in different publications , it is not easy for researchers to use them to process their own datasets. in this paper , we present bento , a workflow management platform with a graphic user interface \( gui \) that is built on top of codalab , to facilitate the process of building clinical nlp pipelines. bento comes with a number of clinical nlp tools that have been pre-trained using medical notes and expert annotations and can be readily used for various clinical nlp tasks. it also allows researchers and developers to create their custom tools \( e.g. , pre-trained nlp models \) and use them in a controlled and reproducible way. in addition , the gui interface enables researchers with limited computer background to compose tools into nlp pipelines and then apply the pipelines on their own datasets in a “what you see is what you get” \( wysiwyg \) way. although bento is designed for clinical nlp applications , the underlying architecture is flexible to be tailored to any other domains.
