OpusFilter: A Configurable Parallel Corpus Filtering Toolbox | Mikko Aulamo | this paper introduces opusfilter , a flexible and modular toolbox for filtering parallel corpora. it implements a number of components based on heuristic filters , language identification libraries , character-based language models , and word alignment tools , and it can easily be extended with custom filters. bitext segments can be ranked according to their quality or domain match using single features or a logistic regression model that can be trained without manually labeled training data. we demonstrate the effectiveness of opusfilter on the example of a finnish-english news translation task based on noisy web-crawled training data. applying our tool leads to improved translation quality while significantly reducing the size of the training data , also clearly outperforming an alternative ranking given in the crawled data set. furthermore , we show the ability of opusfilter to perform data selection for domain adaptation.
