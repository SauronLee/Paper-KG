Tabouid: a Wikipedia-based word guessing game | Timoth√©e Bernard | we present tabouid , a word-guessing game automatically generated from wikipedia. tabouid contains 10 , 000 \( virtual \) cards in english , and as many in french , covering not only words and linguistic expressions but also a variety of topics including artists , historical events or scientific concepts. each card corresponds to a wikipedia article , and conversely , any article could be turned into a card. a range of relatively simple nlp and machine-learning techniques are effectively integrated into a two-stage process. first , a large subset of wikipedia articles are scored - this score estimates the difficulty , or alternatively , the playability of the page. then , the best articles are turned into cards by selecting , for each of them , a list of banned words based on its content. we believe that the game we present is more than mere entertainment and that , furthermore , this paper has pedagogical potential.
