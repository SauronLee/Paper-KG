jiant: A Software Toolkit for Research on General-Purpose Text Understanding Models | Yada Pruksachatkun | we introduce jiant , an open source toolkit for conducting multitask and transfer learning experiments on english nlu tasks. jiant enables modular and configuration driven experimentation with state-of-the-art models and a broad set of tasks for probing , transfer learning , and multitask training experiments. jiant implements over 50 nlu tasks , including all glue and superglue benchmark tasks. we demonstrate that jiant reproduces published performance on a variety of tasks and models , e.g. , roberta and bert.
