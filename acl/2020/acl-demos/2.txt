Syntactic Search by Example | Micah Shlain | we present a system that allows a user to search a large linguistically annotated corpus using syntactic patterns over dependency graphs. in contrast to previous attempts to this effect , we introduce a light-weight query language that does not require the user to know the details of the underlying syntactic representations , and instead to query the corpus by providing an example sentence coupled with simple markup. search is performed at an interactive speed due to efficient linguistic graph-indexing and retrieval engine. this allows for rapid exploration , development and refinement of syntax-based queries. we demonstrate the system using queries over two corpora: the english wikipedia , and a collection of english pubmed abstracts. a demo of the wikipedia system is available at https://allenai.github.io/spike/ .
