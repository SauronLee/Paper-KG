MixingBoard: a Knowledgeable Stylized Integrated Text Generation Platform | Xiang Gao | we present mixingboard , a platform for quickly building demos with a focus on knowledge grounded stylized text generation. we unify existing text generation algorithms in a shared codebase and further adapt earlier algorithms for constrained generation. to borrow advantages from different models , we implement strategies for cross-model integration , from the token probability level to the latent space level. an interface to external knowledge is provided via a module that retrieves , on-the-fly , relevant knowledge from passages on the web or a document collection. a user interface for local development , remote webpage access , and a restful api are provided to make it simple for users to build their own demos.
