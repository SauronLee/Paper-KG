Torch-Struct: Deep Structured Prediction Library | Alexander Rush | the literature on structured prediction for nlp describes a rich collection of distributions and algorithms over sequences , segmentations , alignments , and trees; however , these algorithms are difficult to utilize in deep learning frameworks. we introduce torch-struct , a library for structured prediction designed to take advantage of and integrate with vectorized , auto-differentiation based frameworks. torch-struct includes a broad collection of probabilistic structures accessed through a simple and flexible distribution-based api that connects to any deep learning model. the library utilizes batched , vectorized operations and exploits auto-differentiation to produce readable , fast , and testable code. internally , we also include a number of general-purpose optimizations to provide cross-algorithm efficiency. experiments show significant performance gains over fast baselines and case-studies demonstrate the benefits of the library. torch-struct is available at https://github.com/harvardnlp/pytorch-struct.
