Distractor Analysis and Selection for Multiple-Choice Cloze Questions for Second-Language Learners | Lingyu Gao | we consider the problem of automatically suggesting distractors for multiple-choice cloze questions designed for second-language learners. we describe the creation of a dataset including collecting manual annotations for distractor selection. we assess the relationship between the choices of the annotators and features based on distractors and the correct answers , both with and without the surrounding passage context in the cloze questions. simple features of the distractor and correct answer correlate with the annotations , though we find substantial benefit to additionally using large-scale pretrained models to measure the fit of the distractor in the context. based on these analyses , we propose and train models to automatically select distractors , and measure the importance of model components quantitatively.
