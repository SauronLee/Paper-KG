Predicting the Difficulty and Response Time of Multiple Choice Questions Using Transfer Learning | Kang Xue | this paper investigates whether transfer learning can improve the prediction of the difficulty and response time parameters for 18 , 000 multiple-choice questions from a high-stakes medical exam. the type the signal that best predicts difficulty and response time is also explored , both in terms of representation abstraction and item component used as input \( e.g. , whole item , answer options only , etc. \) . the results indicate that , for our sample , transfer learning can improve the prediction of item difficulty when response time is used as an auxiliary task but not the other way around. in addition , difficulty was best predicted using signal from the item stem \( the description of the clinical case \) , while all parts of the item were important for predicting the response time.
