Interpreting Neural CWI Classifiersâ€™ Weights as Vocabulary Size | Yo Ehara | complex word identification \( cwi \) is a task for the identification of words that are challenging for second-language learners to read. even though the use of neural classifiers is now common in cwi , the interpretation of their parameters remains difficult. this paper analyzes neural cwi classifiers and shows that some of their parameters can be interpreted as vocabulary size. we present a novel formalization of vocabulary size measurement methods that are practiced in the applied linguistics field as a kind of neural classifier. we also contribute to building a novel dataset for validating vocabulary testing and readability via crowdsourcing.
