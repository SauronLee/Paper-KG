Context-based Automated Scoring of Complex Mathematical Responses | Aoife Cahill | the tasks of automatically scoring either textual or algebraic responses to mathematical questions have both been well-studied , albeit separately. in this paper we propose a method for automatically scoring responses that contain both text and algebraic expressions. our method not only achieves high agreement with human raters , but also links explicitly to the scoring rubric â€“ essentially providing explainable models and a way to potentially provide feedback to students in the future.
