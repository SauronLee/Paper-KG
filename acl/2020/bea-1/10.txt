Assisting Undergraduate Students in Writing Spanish Methodology Sections | Samuel González-López | in undergraduate theses , a good methodology section should describe the series of steps that were followed in performing the research. to assist students in this task , we develop machine-learning models and an app that uses them to provide feedback while students write. we construct an annotated corpus that identifies sentences representing methodological steps and labels when a methodology contains a logical sequence of such steps. we train machine-learning models based on language modeling and lexical features that can identify sentences representing methodological steps with 0.939 f-measure , and identify methodology sections containing a logical sequence of steps with an accuracy of 87%. we incorporate these models into a microsoft office add-in , and show that students who improved their methodologies according to the model feedback received better grades on their methodologies.
