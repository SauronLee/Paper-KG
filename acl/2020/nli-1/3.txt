Efficient Deployment of Conversational Natural Language Interfaces over Databases | Anthony Colas | many users communicate with chatbots and ai assistants in order to help them with various tasks. a key component of the assistant is the ability to understand and answer a userâ€™s natural language questions for question-answering \( qa \) . because data can be usually stored in a structured manner , an essential step involves turning a natural language question into its corresponding query language. however , in order to train most natural language-to-query-language state-of-the-art models , a large amount of training data is needed first. in most domains , this data is not available and collecting such datasets for various domains can be tedious and time-consuming. in this work , we propose a novel method for accelerating the training dataset collection for developing the natural language-to-query-language machine learning models. our system allows one to generate conversational multi-term data , where multiple turns define a dialogue session , enabling one to better utilize chatbot interfaces. we train two current state-of-the-art nl-to-ql models , on both an sql and sparql-based datasets in order to showcase the adaptability and efficacy of our created data.
