Answering Complex Questions by Combining Information from Curated and Extracted Knowledge Bases | Nikita Bhutani | knowledge-based question answering \( kb_qa \) has long focused on simple questions that can be answered from a single knowledge source , a manually curated or an automatically extracted kb. in this work , we look at answering complex questions which often require combining information from multiple sources. we present a novel kb-qa system , multique , which can map a complex question to a complex query pattern using a sequence of simple queries each targeted at a specific kb. it finds simple queries using a neural-network based model capable of collective inference over textual relations in extracted kb and ontological relations in curated kb. experiments show that our proposed system outperforms previous kb-qa systems on benchmark datasets , complexwebquestions and webquestionssp.
