Towards Reversal-Based Textual Data Augmentation for NLI Problems with Opposable Classes | Alexey Tarasov | data augmentation methods are commonly used in computer vision and speech. however , in domains dealing with textual data , such techniques are not that common. most of the existing methods rely on rephrasing , i.e. new sentences are generated by changing a source sentence , preserving its meaning. we argue that in tasks with opposable classes \( such as positive and negative in sentiment analysis \) , it might be beneficial to also invert the source sentence , reversing its meaning , to generate examples of the opposing class. methods that use somewhat similar intuition exist in the space of adversarial learning , but are not always applicable to text classification \( in our experiments , some of them were even detrimental to the resulting classifier accuracy \) . we propose and evaluate two reversal-based methods on an nli task of recognising a type of a simple logical expression from its description in plain-text form. after gathering a dataset on mturk , we show that a simple heuristic using a notion of negating the main verb has a potential not only on its own , but that it can also boost existing state-of-the-art rephrasing-based approaches.
