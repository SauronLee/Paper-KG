Feature Difference Makes Sense: A medical image captioning model exploiting feature difference and tag information | Hyeryun Park | medical image captioning can reduce the workload of physicians and save time and expense by automatically generating reports. however , current datasets are small and limited , creating additional challenges for researchers. in this study , we propose a feature difference and tag information combined long short-term memory \( lstm \) model for chest x-ray report generation. a feature vector extracted from the image conveys visual information , but its ability to describe the image is limited. other image captioning studies exhibited improved performance by exploiting feature differences , so the proposed model also utilizes them. first , we propose a difference and tag \( ditag \) model containing the difference between the patient and normal images. then , we propose a multi-difference and tag \( mditag \) model that also contains information about low-level differences , such as contrast , texture , and localized area. evaluation of the proposed models demonstrates that the mditag model provides more information to generate captions and outperforms all other models.
