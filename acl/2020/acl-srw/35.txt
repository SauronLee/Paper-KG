Pre-training via Leveraging Assisting Languages for Neural Machine Translation | Haiyue Song | in this work , we present an effective method for semantic specialization of word vector representations. to this end , we use traditional word embeddings and apply specialization methods to better capture semantic relations between words. in our approach , we leverage external knowledge from rich lexical resources such as babelnet. we also show that our proposed post-specialization method based on an adversarial neural network with the wasserstein distance allows to gain improvements over state-of-the-art methods on two tasks: word similarity and dialog state tracking.
