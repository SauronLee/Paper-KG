Checkpoint Reranking: An Approach to Select Better Hypothesis for Neural Machine Translation Systems | Vinay Pandramish | sequence-to-sequence \( s2s \) pre-training using large monolingual data is known to improve performance for various s2s nlp tasks. however , large monolingual corpora might not always be available for the languages of interest \( loi \) . thus , we propose to exploit monolingual corpora of other languages to complement the scarcity of monolingual corpora for the loi. we utilize script mapping \( chinese to japanese \) to increase the similarity \( number of cognates \) between the monolingual corpora of helping languages and loi. an empirical case study of low-resource japanese-english neural machine translation \( nmt \) reveals that leveraging large chinese and french monolingual corpora can help overcome the shortage of japanese and english monolingual corpora , respectively , for s2s pre-training. using only chinese and french monolingual corpora , we were able to improve japanese-english translation quality by up to 8.5 bleu in low-resource scenarios.
