HGCN4MeSH: Hybrid Graph Convolution Network for MeSH Indexing | Miaomiao Yu | recently deep learning has been used in medical subject headings \( mesh \) indexing to reduce the time and monetary cost by manual annotation , including deepmesh , textcnn , etc. however , these models still suffer from failing to capture the complex correlations between mesh terms. to this end , we introduce graph convolution network \( gcn \) to learn the relationship between these terms , and present a novel hybrid graph convolution net for mesh index \( hgcn4mesh \) . basically , we utilize two bigrus to learn the embedding representation of the abstract and the title of the mesh index text respectively. at the same time , we establish the adjacency matrix of mesh terms based on the co-occurrence relationships in corpus , which is easy to apply for gcn representation learning. on the basis of learning the mixed representation , the prediction problem of the mesh index keywords is transformed into an extreme multi-label classification problem after the attention layer operation. experimental results on two datasets show that hgcn4mesh is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
