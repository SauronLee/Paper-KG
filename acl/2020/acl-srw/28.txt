Embeddings of Label Components for Sequence Labeling: A Case Study of Fine-grained Named Entity Recognition | Takuma Kato | classical and some deep learning techniques for arabic text classification often depend on complex morphological analysis , word segmentation , and hand-crafted feature engineering. these could be eliminated by using character-level features. we propose a novel end-to-end arabic document classification framework , arabic document image-based classifier \( aradic \) , inspired by the work on image-based character embeddings. aradic consists of an image-based character encoder and a classifier. they are trained in an end-to-end fashion using the class balanced loss to deal with the long-tailed data distribution problem. to evaluate the effectiveness of aradic , we created and published two datasets , the arabic wikipedia title \( awt \) dataset and the arabic poetry \( arap \) dataset. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first image-based character embedding framework addressing the problem of arabic text classification. we also present the first deep learning-based text classifier widely evaluated on modern standard arabic , colloquial arabic , and classical arabic. aradic shows performance improvement over classical and deep learning baselines by 12.29% and 23.05% for the micro and macro f-score , respectively.
