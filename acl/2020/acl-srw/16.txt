Non-Topical Coherence in Social Talk: A Call for Dialogue Model Enrichment | Alex Luu | current models of dialogue mainly focus on utterances within a topically coherent discourse segment , rather than new-topic utterances \( ntus \) , which begin a new topic not correlating with the content of prior discourse. as a result , these models may sufficiently account for discourse context of task-oriented but not social conversations. we conduct a pilot annotation study of ntus as a first step towards a model capable of rationalizing conversational coherence in social talk. we start with the naturally occurring social dialogues in the disco-spice corpus , annotated with discourse relations in the penn discourse treebank and cognitive approach to coherence relations frameworks. we first annotate content-based coherence relations that are not available in disco-spice , and then heuristically identify ntus , which lack a coherence relation to prior discourse. based on the interaction between ntus and their discourse context , we construct a classification for ntus that actually convey certain non-topical coherence in social talk. this classification introduces new sequence-based social intents that traditional taxonomies of speech acts do not capture. the new findings advocates the development of a bayesian game-theoretic model for social talk.
