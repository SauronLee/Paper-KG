Topic Balancing with Additive Regularization of Topic Models | Eugeniia Veselova | this article proposes a new approach for building topic models on unbalanced collections in topic modelling , based on the existing methods and our experiments with such methods. real-world data collections contain topics in various proportions , and often documents of the relatively small theme become distributed all over the larger topics instead of being grouped into one topic. to address this issue , we design a new regularizer for theta and phi matrices in probabilistic latent semantic analysis \( plsa \) model. we make sure this regularizer increases the quality of topic models , trained on unbalanced collections. besides , we conceptually support this regularizer by our experiments.
