Exploring Interpretability in Event Extraction: Multitask Learning of a Neural Event Classifier and an Explanation Decoder | Zheng Tang | a large percentage of the worldâ€™s population speaks a language of the indian subcontinent , comprising languages from both indo-aryan \( e.g. hindi , punjabi , gujarati , etc. \) and dravidian \( e.g. tamil , telugu , malayalam , etc. \) families. a universal characteristic of indian languages is their complex morphology , which , when combined with the general lack of sufficient quantities of high-quality parallel data , can make developing machine translation \( mt \) systems for these languages difficult. neural machine translation \( nmt \) is a rapidly advancing mt paradigm and has shown promising results for many language pairs , especially in large training data scenarios. since the condition of large parallel corpora is not met for indian-english language pairs , we present our efforts towards building efficient nmt systems between indian languages \( specifically indo-aryan languages \) and english via efficiently exploiting parallel data from the related languages. we propose a technique called unified transliteration and subword segmentation to leverage language similarity while exploiting parallel data from related language pairs. we also propose a multilingual transfer learning technique to leverage parallel data from multiple related languages to assist translation for low resource language pair of interest. our experiments demonstrate an overall average improvement of 5 bleu points over the standard transformer-based nmt baselines.
