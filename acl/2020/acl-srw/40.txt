Compositional Generalization by Factorizing Alignment and Translation | Jacob Russin | social media posts often contain questions , but many of the questions are rhetorical and do not seek information. our work studies the problem of distinguishing rhetorical and information-seeking questions on twitter. most work has focused on features of the question itself , but we hypothesize that the prior context plays a role too. this paper introduces a new dataset containing questions in tweets paired with their prior tweets to provide context. we create classification models to assess the difficulty of distinguishing rhetorical and information-seeking questions , and experiment with different properties of the prior context. our results show that the prior tweet and topic features can improve performance on this task.
