#NotAWhore! A Computational Linguistic Perspective of Rape Culture and Victimization on Social Media | Ashima Suvarna | standard methods in deep learning for natural language processing fail to capture the compositional structure of human language that allows for systematic generalization outside of the training distribution. however , human learners readily generalize in this way , e.g. by applying known grammatical rules to novel words. inspired by work in cognitive science suggesting a functional distinction between systems for syntactic and semantic processing , we implement a modification to an existing approach in neural machine translation , imposing an analogous separation between alignment and translation. the resulting architecture substantially outperforms standard recurrent networks on the scan dataset , a compositional generalization task , without any additional supervision. our work suggests that learning to align and to translate in separate modules may be a useful heuristic for capturing compositional structure.
