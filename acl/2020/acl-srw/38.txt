Inducing Grammar from Long Short-Term Memory Networks by Shapley Decomposition | Yuhui Zhang | distinguishing informative and actionable messages from a social media platform like twitter is critical for facilitating disaster management. for this purpose , we compile a multilingual dataset of over 130k samples for multi-label classification of disaster-related tweets. we present a masking-based loss function for partially labelled samples and demonstrate the effectiveness of manifold mixup in the text domain. our main model is based on multilingual bert , which we further improve with manifold mixup. we show that our model generalizes to unseen disasters in the test set. furthermore , we analyze the capability of our model for zero-shot generalization to new languages. our code , dataset , and other resources are available on github.
