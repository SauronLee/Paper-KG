Grammatical Error Correction Using Pseudo Learner Corpus Considering Learner’s Error Tendency | Yujin Takahashi | recently , several studies have focused on improving the performance of grammatical error correction \( gec \) tasks using pseudo data. however , a large amount of pseudo data are required to train an accurate gec model. to address the limitations of language and computational resources , we assume that introducing pseudo errors into sentences similar to those written by the language learners is more efficient , rather than incorporating random pseudo errors into monolingual data. in this regard , we study the effect of pseudo data on gec task performance using two approaches. first , we extract sentences that are similar to the learners’ sentences from monolingual data. second , we generate realistic pseudo errors by considering error types that learners often make. based on our comparative results , we observe that f0.5 scores for the russian gec task are significantly improved.
