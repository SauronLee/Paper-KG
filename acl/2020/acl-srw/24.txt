Understanding Points of Correspondence between Sentences for Abstractive Summarization | Logan Lebanoff | parallel corpora are key to developing good machine translation systems. however , abundant parallel data are hard to come by , especially for languages with a low number of speakers. when rich morphology exacerbates the data sparsity problem , it is imperative to have accurate alignment and filtering methods that can help make the most of what is available by maximising the number of correctly translated segments in a corpus and minimising noise by removing incorrect translations and segments containing extraneous data. this paper sets out a research plan for improving alignment and filtering methods for parallel texts in low-resource settings. we propose an effective unsupervised alignment method to tackle the alignment problem. moreover , we propose a strategy to supplement state-of-the-art models with automatically extracted information using basic nlp tools to effectively handle rich morphology.
