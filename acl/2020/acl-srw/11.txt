Media Bias, the Social Sciences, and NLP: Automating Frame Analyses to Identify Bias by Word Choice and Labeling | Felix Hamborg | media bias can strongly impact the public perception of topics reported in the news. a difficult to detect , yet powerful form of slanted news coverage is called bias by word choice and labeling \( wcl \) . wcl bias can occur , for example , when journalists refer to the same semantic concept by using different terms that frame the concept differently and consequently may lead to different assessments by readers , such as the terms “freedom fighters” and “terrorists , ” or “gun rights” and “gun control.” in this research project , i aim to devise methods that identify instances of wcl bias and estimate the frames they induce , e.g. , not only is “terrorists” of negative polarity but also ascribes to aggression and fear. to achieve this , i plan to research methods using natural language processing and deep learning while employing models and using analysis concepts from the social sciences , where researchers have studied media bias for decades. the first results indicate the effectiveness of this interdisciplinary research approach. my vision is to devise a system that helps news readers to become aware of the differences in media coverage caused by bias.
