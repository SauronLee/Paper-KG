uBLEU: Uncertainty-Aware Automatic Evaluation Method for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems | Yuma Tsuta | fusing sentences containing disparate content is a remarkable human ability that helps create informative and succinct summaries. such a simple task for humans has remained challenging for modern abstractive summarizers , substantially restricting their applicability in real-world scenarios. in this paper , we present an investigation into fusing sentences drawn from a document by introducing the notion of points of correspondence , which are cohesive devices that tie any two sentences together into a coherent text. the types of points of correspondence are delineated by text cohesion theory , covering pronominal and nominal referencing , repetition and beyond. we create a dataset containing the documents , source and fusion sentences , and human annotations of points of correspondence between sentences. our dataset bridges the gap between coreference resolution and summarization. it is publicly shared to serve as a basis for future work to measure the success of sentence fusion systems.
