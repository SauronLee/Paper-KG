Building a Japanese Typo Dataset from Wikipediaâ€™s Revision History | Yu Tanaka | in general , the labels used in sequence labeling consist of different types of elements. for example , iob-format entity labels , such as b-person and i-person , can be decomposed into span \( b and i \) and type information \( person \) . however , while most sequence labeling models do not consider such label components , the shared components across labels , such as person , can be beneficial for label prediction. in this work , we propose to integrate label component information as embeddings into models. through experiments on english and japanese fine-grained named entity recognition , we demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance , especially for instances with low-frequency labels.
