Combining Subword Representations into Word-level Representations in the Transformer Architecture | Noe Casas | in neural machine translation , using word-level tokens leads to degradation in translation quality. the dominant approaches use subword-level tokens , but this increases the length of the sequences and makes it difficult to profit from word-level information such as pos tags or semantic dependencies. we propose a modification to the transformer model to combine subword-level representations into word-level ones in the first layers of the encoder , reducing the effective length of the sequences in the following layers and providing a natural point to incorporate extra word-level information. our experiments show that this approach maintains the translation quality with respect to the normal transformer model when no extra word-level information is injected and that it is superior to the currently dominant method for incorporating word-level source language information to models based on subword-level vocabularies.
