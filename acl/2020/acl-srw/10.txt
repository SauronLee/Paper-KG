Zero-shot North Korean to English Neural Machine Translation by Character Tokenization and Phoneme Decomposition | Hwichan Kim | the primary limitation of north korean to english translation is the lack of a parallel corpus; therefore , high translation accuracy cannot be achieved. to address this problem , we propose a zero-shot approach using south korean data , which are remarkably similar to north korean data. we train a neural machine translation model after tokenizing a south korean text at the character level and decomposing characters into phonemes.we demonstrate that our method can effectively learn north korean to english translation and improve the bleu scores by +1.01 points in comparison with the baseline.
