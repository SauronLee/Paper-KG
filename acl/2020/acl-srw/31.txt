How much complexity does an RNN architecture need to learn syntax-sensitive dependencies? | Gantavya Bhatt | many recent short answer scoring \( sas \) systems have employed quadratic weighted kappa \( qwk \) as the evaluation measure of their systems. however , we hypothesize that qwk is unsatisfactory for the evaluation of the sas systems when we consider measuring their effectiveness in actual usage. we introduce a new task formulation of sas that matches the actual usage. in our formulation , the sas systems should extract as many scoring predictions that are not critical scoring errors \( cses \) . we conduct the experiments in our new task formulation and demonstrate that a typical sas system can predict scores with zero cse for approximately 50% of test data at maximum by filtering out low-reliablility predictions on the basis of a certain confidence estimation. this result directly indicates the possibility of reducing half the scoring cost of human raters , which is more preferable for the evaluation of sas systems.
