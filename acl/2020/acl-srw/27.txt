AraDIC: Arabic Document Classification Using Image-Based Character Embeddings and Class-Balanced Loss | Mahmoud Daif | this paper describes the development of a verbal morphological parser for an under-resourced papuan language , nen. nen verbal morphology is particularly complex , with a transitive verb taking up to 1 , 740 unique features. the structural properties exhibited by nen verbs raises interesting choices for analysis. here we compare two possible methods of analysis: ‘chunking’ and decomposition. ‘chunking’ refers to the concept of collating morphological segments into one , whereas the decomposition model follows a more classical linguistic approach. both models are built using the finite-state transducer toolkit foma. the resultant architecture shows differences in size and structural clarity. while the ‘chunking’ model is under half the size of the full de-composed counterpart , the decomposition displays higher structural order. in this paper , we describe the challenges encountered when modelling a language exhibiting distributed exponence and present the first morphological analyser for nen , with an overall accuracy of 80.3%.
