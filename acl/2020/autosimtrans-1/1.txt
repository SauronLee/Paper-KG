End-to-End Speech Translation with Adversarial Training | Xuancai Li | end-to-end speech translation usually leverages audio-to-text parallel data to train an available speech translation model which has shown impressive results on various speech translation tasks. due to the artificial cost of collecting audio-to-text parallel data , the speech translation is a natural low-resource translation scenario , which greatly hinders its improvement. in this paper , we proposed a new adversarial training method to leverage target monolingual data to relieve the low-resource shortcoming of speech translation. in our method , the existing speech translation model is considered as a generator to gain a target language output , and another neural discriminator is used to guide the distinction between outputs of speech translation model and true target monolingual sentences. experimental results on the ccmt 2019-bstc dataset speech translation task demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of the end-to-end speech translation system.
