Dynamic Sentence Boundary Detection for Simultaneous Translation | Ruiqing Zhang | simultaneous translation is a great challenge in which translation starts before the source sentence finished. most studies take transcription as input and focus on balancing translation quality and latency for each sentence. however , most asr systems can not provide accurate sentence boundaries in realtime. thus it is a key problem to segment sentences for the word streaming before translation. in this paper , we propose a novel method for sentence boundary detection that takes it as a multi-class classification task under the end-to-end pre-training framework. experiments show significant improvements both in terms of translation quality and latency.
