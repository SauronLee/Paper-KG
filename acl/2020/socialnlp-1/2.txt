NARMADA: Need and Available Resource Managing Assistant for Disasters and Adversities | Kaustubh Hiware | although a lot of research has been done on utilising online social media during disasters , there exists no system for a specific task that is critical in a post-disaster scenario â€“ identifying resource-needs and resource-availabilities in the disaster-affected region , coupled with their subsequent matching. to this end , we present narmada , a semi-automated platform which leverages the crowd-sourced information from social media posts for assisting post-disaster relief coordination efforts. the system employs natural language processing and information retrieval techniques for identifying resource-needs and resource-availabilities from microblogs , extracting resources from the posts , and also matching the needs to suitable availabilities. the system is thus capable of facilitating the judicious management of resources during post-disaster relief operations.
