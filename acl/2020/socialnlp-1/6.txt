Incorporating Uncertain Segmentation Information into Chinese NER for Social Media Text | Shengbin Jia | chinese word segmentation is necessary to provide word-level information for chinese named entity recognition \( ner \) systems. however , segmentation error propagation is a challenge for chinese ner while processing colloquial data like social media text. in this paper , we propose a model \( uicwsnn \) that specializes in identifying entities from chinese social media text , especially by leveraging uncertain information of word segmentation. such ambiguous information contains all the potential segmentation states of a sentence that provides a channel for the model to infer deep word-level characteristics. we propose a trilogy \( i.e. , candidate position embedding => position selective attention => adaptive word convolution \) to encode uncertain word segmentation information and acquire appropriate word-level representation. experimental results on the social media corpus show that our model alleviates the segmentation error cascading trouble effectively , and achieves a significant performance improvement of 2% over previous state-of-the-art methods.
