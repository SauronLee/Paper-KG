Stance Prediction for Contemporary Issues: Data and Experiments | Marjan Hosseinia | we investigate whether pre-trained bidirectional transformers with sentiment and emotion information improve stance detection in long discussions of contemporary issues. as a part of this work , we create a novel stance detection dataset covering 419 different controversial issues and their related pros and cons collected by procon.org in nonpartisan format. experimental results show that a shallow recurrent neural network with sentiment or emotion information can reach competitive results compared to fine-tuned bert with 20x fewer parameters. we also use a simple approach that explains which input phrases contribute to stance detection.
