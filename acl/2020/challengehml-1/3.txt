Low Rank Fusion based Transformers for Multimodal Sequences | Saurav Sahay | our senses individually work in a coordinated fashion to express our emotional intentions. in this work , we experiment with modeling modality-specific sensory signals to attend to our latent multimodal emotional intentions and vice versa expressed via low-rank multimodal fusion and multimodal transformers. the low-rank factorization of multimodal fusion amongst the modalities helps represent approximate multiplicative latent signal interactions. motivated by the work of~ \( citation \) and~ \( citation \) , we present our transformer-based cross-fusion architecture without any over-parameterization of the model. the low-rank fusion helps represent the latent signal interactions while the modality-specific attention helps focus on relevant parts of the signal. we present two methods for the multimodal sentiment and emotion recognition results on cmu-mosei , cmu-mosi , and iemocap datasets and show that our models have lesser parameters , train faster and perform comparably to many larger fusion-based architectures.
