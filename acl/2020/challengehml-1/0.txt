A Transformer-based joint-encoding for Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis | Jean-Benoit Delbrouck | understanding expressed sentiment and emotions are two crucial factors in human multimodal language. this paper describes a transformer-based joint-encoding \( tbje \) for the task of emotion recognition and sentiment analysis. in addition to use the transformer architecture , our approach relies on a modular co-attention and a glimpse layer to jointly encode one or more modalities. the proposed solution has also been submitted to the acl20: second grand-challenge on multimodal language to be evaluated on the cmu-mosei dataset. the code to replicate the presented experiments is open-source .
