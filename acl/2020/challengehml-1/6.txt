Audio-Visual Understanding of Passenger Intents for In-Cabin Conversational Agents | Eda Okur | building multimodal dialogue understanding capabilities situated in the in-cabin context is crucial to enhance passenger comfort in autonomous vehicle \( av \) interaction systems. to this end , understanding passenger intents from spoken interactions and vehicle vision systems is an important building block for developing contextual and visually grounded conversational agents for av. towards this goal , we explore amie \( automated-vehicle multimodal in-cabin experience \) , the in-cabin agent responsible for handling multimodal passenger-vehicle interactions. in this work , we discuss the benefits of multimodal understanding of in-cabin utterances by incorporating verbal/language input together with the non-verbal/acoustic and visual input from inside and outside the vehicle. our experimental results outperformed text-only baselines as we achieved improved performances for intent detection with multimodal approach.
