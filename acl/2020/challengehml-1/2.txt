Multilogue-Net: A Context-Aware RNN for Multi-modal Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis in Conversation | Aman Shenoy | sentiment analysis and emotion detection in conversation is key in several real-world applications , with an increase in modalities available aiding a better understanding of the underlying emotions. multi-modal emotion detection and sentiment analysis can be particularly useful , as applications will be able to use specific subsets of available modalities , as per the available data. current systems dealing with multi-modal functionality fail to leverage and capture - the context of the conversation through all modalities , the dependency between the listener \( s \) and speaker emotional states , and the relevance and relationship between the available modalities. in this paper , we propose an end to end rnn architecture that attempts to take into account all the mentioned drawbacks. our proposed model , at the time of writing , out-performs the state of the art on a benchmark dataset on a variety of accuracy and regression metrics.
