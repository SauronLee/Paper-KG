Evaluating Compositionality of Sentence Representation Models | Hanoz Bhathena | we evaluate the compositionality of general-purpose sentence encoders by proposing two different metrics to quantify compositional understanding capability of sentence encoders. we introduce a novel metric , polarity sensitivity scoring \( pss \) , which utilizes sentiment perturbations as a proxy for measuring compositionality. we then compare results from pss with those obtained via our proposed extension of a metric called tree reconstruction error \( tre \) \( citation \) where compositionality is evaluated by measuring how well a true representation producing model can be approximated by a model that explicitly combines representations of its primitives.
