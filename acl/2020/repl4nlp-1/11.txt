A Metric Learning Approach to Misogyny Categorization | Juan Manuel Coria | the task of automatic misogyny identification and categorization has not received as much attention as other natural language tasks have , even though it is crucial for identifying hate speech in social internet interactions. in this work , we address this sentence classification task from a representation learning perspective , using both a bidirectional lstm and bert optimized with the following metric learning loss functions: contrastive loss , triplet loss , center loss , congenerous cosine loss and additive angular margin loss. we set new state-of-the-art for the task with our fine-tuned bert , whose sentence embeddings can be compared with a simple cosine distance , and we release all our code as open source for easy reproducibility. moreover , we find that almost every loss function performs equally well in this setting , matching the regular cross entropy loss.
