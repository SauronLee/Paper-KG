Adversarial Alignment of Multilingual Models for Extracting Temporal Expressions from Text | Lukas Lange | although temporal tagging is still dominated by rule-based systems , there have been recent attempts at neural temporal taggers. however , all of them focus on monolingual settings. in this paper , we explore multilingual methods for the extraction of temporal expressions from text and investigate adversarial training for aligning embedding spaces to one common space. with this , we create a single multilingual model that can also be transferred to unseen languages and set the new state of the art in those cross-lingual transfer experiments.
