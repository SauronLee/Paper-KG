Improving Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Unsupervised Post-Processing of Monolingual Word Vector Spaces | Ivan VuliÄ‡ | work on projection-based induction of cross-lingual word embedding spaces \( clwes \) predominantly focuses on the improvement of the projection \( i.e. , mapping \) mechanisms. in this work , in contrast , we show that a simple method for post-processing monolingual embedding spaces facilitates learning of the cross-lingual alignment and , in turn , substantially improves bilingual lexicon induction \( bli \) . the post-processing method we examine is grounded in the generalisation of first- and second-order monolingual similarities to the nth-order similarity. by post-processing monolingual spaces before the cross-lingual alignment , the method can be coupled with any projection-based method for inducing clwe spaces. we demonstrate the effectiveness of this simple monolingual post-processing across a set of 15 typologically diverse languages \( i.e. , 15*14 bli setups \) , and in combination with two different projection methods.
