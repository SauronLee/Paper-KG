Context-Driven Satirical News Generation | Zachary Horvitz | while mysterious , humor likely hinges on an interplay of entities , their relationships , and cultural connotations. motivated by the importance of context in humor , we consider methods for constructing and leveraging contextual representations in generating humorous text. specifically , we study the capacity of transformer-based architectures to generate funny satirical headlines , and show that both language models and summarization models can be fine-tuned to regularly generate headlines that people find funny. furthermore , we find that summarization models uniquely support satire-generation by enabling the generation of topical humorous text. outside of our formal study , we note that headlines generated by our model were accepted via a competitive process into a satirical newspaper , and one headline was ranked as high or better than 73% of human submissions. as part of our work , we contribute a dataset of over 15k satirical headlines paired with ranked contextual information from news articles and wikipedia.
