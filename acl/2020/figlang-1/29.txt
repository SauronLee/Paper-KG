Metaphor Detection using Context and Concreteness | Rowan Hall Maudslay | we report the results of our system on the metaphor detection shared task at the second workshop on figurative language processing 2020. our model is an ensemble , utilising contextualised and static distributional semantic representations , along with word-type concreteness ratings. using these features , it predicts word metaphoricity with a deep multi-layer perceptron. we are able to best the state-of-the-art from the 2018 shared task by an average of 8.0% f1 , and finish fourth in both sub-tasks in which we participate.
