A Transformer Approach to Contextual Sarcasm Detection in Twitter | Hunter Gregory | understanding tone in twitter posts will be increasingly important as more and more communication moves online. one of the most difficult , yet important tones to detect is sarcasm. in the past , lstm and transformer architecture models have been used to tackle this problem. we attempt to expand upon this research , implementing lstm , gru , and transformer models , and exploring new methods to classify sarcasm in twitter posts. among these , the most successful were transformer models , most notably bert. while we attempted a few other models described in this paper , our most successful model was an ensemble of transformer models including bert , roberta , xlnet , roberta-large , and albert. this research was performed in conjunction with the sarcasm detection shared task section in the second workshop on figurative language processing , co-located with acl 2020.
