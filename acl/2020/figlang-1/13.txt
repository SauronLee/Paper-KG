A Novel Hierarchical BERT Architecture for Sarcasm Detection | Himani Srivastava | online discussion platforms are often flooded with opinions from users across the world on a variety of topics. many such posts , comments , or utterances are often sarcastic in nature , i.e. , the actual intent is hidden in the sentence and is different from its literal meaning , making the detection of such utterances challenging without additional context. in this paper , we propose a novel deep learning-based approach to detect whether an utterance is sarcastic or non-sarcastic by utilizing the given contexts ina hierarchical manner. we have used datasets from two online discussion platforms - twitter and reddit1for our experiments. experimental and error analysis shows that the hierarchical models can make full use of history to obtain a better representation of contexts and thus , in turn , can outperform their sequential counterparts.
