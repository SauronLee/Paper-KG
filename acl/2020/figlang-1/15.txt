Using Conceptual Norms for Metaphor Detection | Mingyu Wan | this paper reports a linguistically-enriched method of detecting token-level metaphors for the second shared task on metaphor detection. we participate in all four phases of competition with both datasets , i.e. verbs and allpos on the vua and the tofel datasets. we use the modality exclusivity and embodiment norms for constructing a conceptual representation of the nodes and the context. our system obtains an f-score of 0.652 for the vua verbs track , which is 5% higher than the strong baselines. the experimental results across models and datasets indicate the salient contribution of using modality exclusivity and modality shift information for predicting metaphoricity.
