Supervised Disambiguation of German Verbal Idioms with a BiLSTM Architecture | Rafael Ehren | supervised disambiguation of verbal idioms \( vid \) poses special demands on the quality and quantity of the annotated data used for learning and evaluation. in this paper , we present a new vid corpus for german and perform a series of vid disambiguation experiments on it. our best classifier , based on a neural architecture , yields an error reduction across vids of 57% in terms of accuracy compared to a simple majority baseline.
