Sky + Fire = Sunset. Exploring Parallels between Visually Grounded Metaphors and Image Classifiers | Yuri Bizzoni | this work explores the differences and similarities between neural image classifiersâ€™ mis-categorisations and visually grounded metaphors - that we could conceive as intentional mis-categorisations. we discuss the possibility of using automatic image classifiers to approximate human metaphoric behaviours , and the limitations of such frame. we report two pilot experiments to study grounded metaphoricity. in the first we represent metaphors as a form of visual mis-categorisation. in the second we model metaphors as a more flexible , compositional operation in a continuous visual space generated from automatic classification systems.
