Go Figure! Multi-task transformer-based architecture for metaphor detection using idioms: ETS team in 2020 metaphor shared task | Xianyang Chen | this paper describes the ets entry to the 2020 metaphor detection shared task. our contribution consists of a sequence of experiments using bert , starting with a baseline , strengthening it by spell-correcting the toefl corpus , followed by a multi-task learning setting , where one of the tasks is the token-level metaphor classification as per the shared task , while the other is meant to provide additional training that we hypothesized to be relevant to the main task. in one case , out-of-domain data manually annotated for metaphor is used for the auxiliary task; in the other case , in-domain data automatically annotated for idioms is used for the auxiliary task. both multi-task experiments yield promising results.
