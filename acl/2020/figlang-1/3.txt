DeepMet: A Reading Comprehension Paradigm for Token-level Metaphor Detection | Chuandong Su | machine metaphor understanding is one of the major topics in nlp. most of the recent attempts consider it as classification or sequence tagging task. however , few types of research introduce the rich linguistic information into the field of computational metaphor by leveraging powerful pre-training language models. we focus a novel reading comprehension paradigm for solving the token-level metaphor detection task which provides an innovative type of solution for this task. we propose an end-to-end deep metaphor detection model named deepmet based on this paradigm. the proposed approach encodes the global text context \( whole sentence \) , local text context \( sentence fragments \) , and question \( query word \) information as well as incorporating two types of part-of-speech \( pos \) features by making use of the advanced pre-training language model. the experimental results by using several metaphor datasets show that our model achieves competitive results in the second shared task on metaphor detection.
