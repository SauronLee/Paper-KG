Metaphor Detection Using Contextual Word Embeddings From Transformers | Jerry Liu | the detection of metaphors can provide valuable information about a given text and is crucial to sentiment analysis and machine translation. in this paper , we outline the techniques for word-level metaphor detection used in our submission to the second shared task on metaphor detection. we propose using both bert and xlnet language models to create contextualized embeddings and a bi-directional lstm to identify whether a given word is a metaphor. our best model achieved f1-scores of 68.0% on vua allpos , 73.0% on vua verbs , 66.9% on toefl allpos , and 69.7% on toefl verbs , placing 7th , 6th , 5th , and 5th respectively. in addition , we outline another potential approach with a knn-lstm ensemble model that we did not have enough time to implement given the deadline for the competition. we show that a knn classifier provides a similar f1-score on a validation set as the lstm and yields different information on metaphors.
