ALBERT-BiLSTM for Sequential Metaphor Detection | Shuqun Li | in our daily life , metaphor is a common way of expression. to understand the meaning of a metaphor , we should recognize the metaphor words which play important roles. in the metaphor detection task , we design a sequence labeling model based on albert-lstm-softmax. by applying this model , we carry out a lot of experiments and compare the experimental results with different processing methods , such as with different input sentences and tokens , or the methods with crf and softmax. then , some tricks are adopted to improve the experimental results. finally , our model achieves a 0.707 f1-score for the all pos subtask and a 0.728 f1-score for the verb subtask on the toefl dataset.
