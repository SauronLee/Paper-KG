Can Humor Prediction Datasets be used for Humor Generation? Humorous Headline Generation via Style Transfer | Orion Weller | understanding and identifying humor has been increasingly popular , as seen by the number of datasets created to study humor. however , one area of humor research , humor generation , has remained a difficult task , with machine generated jokes failing to match human-created humor. as many humor prediction datasets claim to aid in generative tasks , we examine whether these claims are true. we focus our experiments on the most popular dataset , included in the 2020 semeval’s task 7 , and teach our model to take normal text and “translate” it into humorous text. we evaluate our model compared to humorous human generated headlines , finding that our model is preferred equally in a/b testing with the human edited versions , a strong success for humor generation , and is preferred over an intelligent random baseline 72% of the time. we also show that our model is assumed to be human written comparable with that of the human edited headlines and is significantly better than random , indicating that this dataset does indeed provide potential for future humor generation systems.
