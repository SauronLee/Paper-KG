Recognizing Euphemisms and Dysphemisms Using Sentiment Analysis | Christian Felt | this paper presents the first research aimed at recognizing euphemistic and dysphemistic phrases with natural language processing. euphemisms soften references to topics that are sensitive , disagreeable , or taboo. conversely , dysphemisms refer to sensitive topics in a harsh or rude way. for example , “passed away” and “departed” are euphemisms for death , while “croaked” and “six feet under” are dysphemisms for death. our work explores the use of sentiment analysis to recognize euphemistic and dysphemistic language. first , we identify near-synonym phrases for three topics \( firing , lying , and stealing \) using a bootstrapping algorithm for semantic lexicon induction. next , we classify phrases as euphemistic , dysphemistic , or neutral using lexical sentiment cues and contextual sentiment analysis. we introduce a new gold standard data set and present our experimental results for this task.
