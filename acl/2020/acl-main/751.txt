TriggerNER: Learning with Entity Triggers as Explanations for Named Entity Recognition | Bill Yuchen Lin | training neural models for named entity recognition \( ner \) in a new domain often requires additional human annotations \( e.g. , tens of thousands of labeled instances \) that are usually expensive and time-consuming to collect. thus , a crucial research question is how to obtain supervision in a cost-effective way. in this paper , we introduce “entity triggers , ” an effective proxy of human explanations for facilitating label-efficient learning of ner models. an entity trigger is defined as a group of words in a sentence that helps to explain why humans would recognize an entity in the sentence. we crowd-sourced 14k entity triggers for two well-studied ner datasets. our proposed model , trigger matching network , jointly learns trigger representations and soft matching module with self-attention such that can generalize to unseen sentences easily for tagging. our framework is significantly more cost-effective than the traditional neural ner frameworks. experiments show that using only 20% of the trigger-annotated sentences results in a comparable performance as using 70% of conventional annotated sentences.
