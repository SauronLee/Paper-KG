Fine-Grained Analysis of Cross-Linguistic Syntactic Divergences | Dmitry Nikolaev | the patterns in which the syntax of different languages converges and diverges are often used to inform work on cross-lingual transfer. nevertheless , little empirical work has been done on quantifying the prevalence of different syntactic divergences across language pairs. we propose a framework for extracting divergence patterns for any language pair from a parallel corpus , building on universal dependencies. we show that our framework provides a detailed picture of cross-language divergences , generalizes previous approaches , and lends itself to full automation. we further present a novel dataset , a manually word-aligned subset of the parallel ud corpus in five languages , and use it to perform a detailed corpus study. we demonstrate the usefulness of the resulting analysis by showing that it can help account for performance patterns of a cross-lingual parser.
