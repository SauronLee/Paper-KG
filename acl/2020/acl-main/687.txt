In Neural Machine Translation, What Does Transfer Learning Transfer? | Alham Fikri Aji | transfer learning improves quality for low-resource machine translation , but it is unclear what exactly it transfers. we perform several ablation studies that limit information transfer , then measure the quality impact across three language pairs to gain a black-box understanding of transfer learning. word embeddings play an important role in transfer learning , particularly if they are properly aligned. although transfer learning can be performed without embeddings , results are sub-optimal. in contrast , transferring only the embeddings but nothing else yields catastrophic results. we then investigate diagonal alignments with auto-encoders over real languages and randomly generated sequences , finding even randomly generated sequences as parents yield noticeable but smaller gains. finally , transfer learning can eliminate the need for a warm-up phase when training transformer models in high resource language pairs.
