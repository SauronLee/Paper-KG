A Generate-and-Rank Framework with Semantic Type Regularization for Biomedical Concept Normalization | Dongfang Xu | concept normalization , the task of linking textual mentions of concepts to concepts in an ontology , is challenging because ontologies are large. in most cases , annotated datasets cover only a small sample of the concepts , yet concept normalizers are expected to predict all concepts in the ontology. in this paper , we propose an architecture consisting of a candidate generator and a list-wise ranker based on bert. the ranker considers pairings of concept mentions and candidate concepts , allowing it to make predictions for any concept , not just those seen during training. we further enhance this list-wise approach with a semantic type regularizer that allows the model to incorporate semantic type information from the ontology during training. our proposed concept normalization framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.
