Generate, Delete and Rewrite: A Three-Stage Framework for Improving Persona Consistency of Dialogue Generation | Haoyu Song | maintaining a consistent personality in conversations is quite natural for human beings , but is still a non-trivial task for machines. the persona-based dialogue generation task is thus introduced to tackle the personality-inconsistent problem by incorporating explicit persona text into dialogue generation models. despite the success of existing persona-based models on generating human-like responses , their one-stage decoding framework can hardly avoid the generation of inconsistent persona words. in this work , we introduce a three-stage framework that employs a generate-delete-rewrite mechanism to delete inconsistent words from a generated response prototype and further rewrite it to a personality-consistent one. we carry out evaluations by both human and automatic metrics. experiments on the persona-chat dataset show that our approach achieves good performance.
