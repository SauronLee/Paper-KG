Active Learning for Coreference Resolution using Discrete Annotation | Belinda Z. Li | we improve upon pairwise annotation for active learning in coreference resolution , by asking annotators to identify mention antecedents if a presented mention pair is deemed not coreferent. this simple modification , when combined with a novel mention clustering algorithm for selecting which examples to label , is much more efficient in terms of the performance obtained per annotation budget. in experiments with existing benchmark coreference datasets , we show that the signal from this additional question leads to significant performance gains per human-annotation hour. future work can use our annotation protocol to effectively develop coreference models for new domains. our code is publicly available.
