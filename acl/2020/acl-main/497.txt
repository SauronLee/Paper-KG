Crossing Variational Autoencoders for Answer Retrieval | Wenhao Yu | answer retrieval is to find the most aligned answer from a large set of candidates given a question. learning vector representations of questions/answers is the key factor. question-answer alignment and question/answer semantics are two important signals for learning the representations. existing methods learned semantic representations with dual encoders or dual variational auto-encoders. the semantic information was learned from language models or question-to-question \( answer-to-answer \) generative processes. however , the alignment and semantics were too separate to capture the aligned semantics between question and answer. in this work , we propose to cross variational auto-encoders by generating questions with aligned answers and generating answers with aligned questions. experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art answer retrieval method on squad.
