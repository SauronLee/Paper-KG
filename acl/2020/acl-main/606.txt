Semi-Supervised Semantic Dependency Parsing Using CRF Autoencoders | Zixia Jia | semantic dependency parsing , which aims to find rich bi-lexical relationships , allows words to have multiple dependency heads , resulting in graph-structured representations. we propose an approach to semi-supervised learning of semantic dependency parsers based on the crf autoencoder framework. our encoder is a discriminative neural semantic dependency parser that predicts the latent parse graph of the input sentence. our decoder is a generative neural model that reconstructs the input sentence conditioned on the latent parse graph. our model is arc-factored and therefore parsing and learning are both tractable. experiments show our model achieves significant and consistent improvement over the supervised baseline.
