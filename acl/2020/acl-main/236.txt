Interactive Classification by Asking Informative Questions | Lili Yu | we study the potential for interaction in natural language classification. we add a limited form of interaction for intent classification , where users provide an initial query using natural language , and the system asks for additional information using binary or multi-choice questions. at each turn , our system decides between asking the most informative question or making the final classification pre-diction. the simplicity of the model allows for bootstrapping of the system without interaction data , instead relying on simple crowd-sourcing tasks. we evaluate our approach on two domains , showing the benefit of interaction and the advantage of learning to balance between asking additional questions and making the final prediction.
