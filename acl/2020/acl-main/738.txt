Beyond Possession Existence: Duration and Co-Possession | Dhivya Chinnappa | this paper introduces two tasks: determining \( a \) the duration of possession relations and \( b \) co-possessions , i.e. , whether multiple possessors possess a possessee at the same time. we present new annotations on top of corpora annotating possession existence and experimental results. regarding possession duration , we derive the time spans we work with empirically from annotations indicating lower and upper bounds. regarding co-possessions , we use a binary label. cohenâ€™s kappa coefficients indicate substantial agreement , and experimental results show that text is more useful than the image for solving these tasks.
