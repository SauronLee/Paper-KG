SEEK: Segmented Embedding of Knowledge Graphs | Wentao Xu | in recent years , knowledge graph embedding becomes a pretty hot research topic of artificial intelligence and plays increasingly vital roles in various downstream applications , such as recommendation and question answering. however , existing methods for knowledge graph embedding can not make a proper trade-off between the model complexity and the model expressiveness , which makes them still far from satisfactory. to mitigate this problem , we propose a lightweight modeling framework that can achieve highly competitive relational expressiveness without increasing the model complexity. our framework focuses on the design of scoring functions and highlights two critical characteristics: 1 \) facilitating sufficient feature interactions; 2 \) preserving both symmetry and antisymmetry properties of relations. it is noteworthy that owing to the general and elegant design of scoring functions , our framework can incorporate many famous existing methods as special cases. moreover , extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework. source codes and data can be found at
