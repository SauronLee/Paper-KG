Machine Reading of Historical Events | Or Honovich | machine reading is an ambitious goal in nlp that subsumes a wide range of text understanding capabilities. within this broad framework , we address the task of machine reading the time of historical events , compile datasets for the task , and develop a model for tackling it. given a brief textual description of an event , we show that good performance can be achieved by extracting relevant sentences from wikipedia , and applying a combination of task-specific and general-purpose feature embeddings for the classification. furthermore , we establish a link between the historical event ordering task and the event focus time task from the information retrieval literature , showing they also provide a challenging test case for machine reading algorithms.
