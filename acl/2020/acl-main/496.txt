Benefits of Intermediate Annotations in Reading Comprehension | Dheeru Dua | complex compositional reading comprehension datasets require performing latent sequential decisions that are learned via supervision from the final answer. a large combinatorial space of possible decision paths that result in the same answer , compounded by the lack of intermediate supervision to help choose the right path , makes the learning particularly hard for this task. in this work , we study the benefits of collecting intermediate reasoning supervision along with the answer during data collection. we find that these intermediate annotations can provide two-fold benefits. first , we observe that for any collection budget , spending a fraction of it on intermediate annotations results in improved model performance , for two complex compositional datasets: drop and quoref. second , these annotations encourage the model to learn the correct latent reasoning steps , helping combat some of the biases introduced during the data collection process.
