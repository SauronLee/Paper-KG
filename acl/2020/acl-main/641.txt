Aligned Dual Channel Graph Convolutional Network for Visual Question Answering | Qingbao Huang | visual question answering aims to answer the natural language question about a given image. existing graph-based methods only focus on the relations between objects in an image and neglect the importance of the syntactic dependency relations between words in a question. to simultaneously capture the relations between objects in an image and the syntactic dependency relations between words in a question , we propose a novel dual channel graph convolutional network \( dc-gcn \) for better combining visual and textual advantages. the dc-gcn model consists of three parts: an i-gcn module to capture the relations between objects in an image , a q-gcn module to capture the syntactic dependency relations between words in a question , and an attention alignment module to align image representations and question representations. experimental results show that our model achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approaches.
