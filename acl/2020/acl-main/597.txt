Unsupervised Morphological Paradigm Completion | Huiming Jin | we propose the task of unsupervised morphological paradigm completion. given only raw text and a lemma list , the task consists of generating the morphological paradigms , i.e. , all inflected forms , of the lemmas. from a natural language processing \( nlp \) perspective , this is a challenging unsupervised task , and high-performing systems have the potential to improve tools for low-resource languages or to assist linguistic annotators. from a cognitive science perspective , this can shed light on how children acquire morphological knowledge. we further introduce a system for the task , which generates morphological paradigms via the following steps: \( i \) edit tree retrieval , \( ii \) additional lemma retrieval , \( iii \) paradigm size discovery , and \( iv \) inflection generation. we perform an evaluation on 14 typologically diverse languages. our system outperforms trivial baselines with ease and , for some languages , even obtains a higher accuracy than minimally supervised systems.
