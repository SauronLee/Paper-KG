Improving Segmentation for Technical Support Problems | Kushal Chauhan | technical support problems are often long and complex. they typically contain user descriptions of the problem , the setup , and steps for attempted resolution. often they also contain various non-natural language text elements like outputs of commands , snippets of code , error messages or stack traces. these elements contain potentially crucial information for problem resolution. however , they cannot be correctly parsed by tools designed for natural language. in this paper , we address the problem of segmentation for technical support questions. we formulate the problem as a sequence labelling task , and study the performance of state of the art approaches. we compare this against an intuitive contextual sentence-level classification baseline , and a state of the art supervised text-segmentation approach. we also introduce a novel component of combining contextual embeddings from multiple language models pre-trained on different data sources , which achieves a marked improvement over using embeddings from a single pre-trained language model. finally , we also demonstrate the usefulness of such segmentation with improvements on the downstream task of answer retrieval.
