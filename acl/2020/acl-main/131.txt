Bridging Anaphora Resolution as Question Answering | Yufang Hou | most previous studies on bridging anaphora resolution \( poesio et al. , 2004; hou et al. , 2013b; hou , 2018a \) use the pairwise model to tackle the problem and assume that the gold mention information is given. in this paper , we cast bridging anaphora resolution as question answering based on context. this allows us to find the antecedent for a given anaphor without knowing any gold mention information \( except the anaphor itself \) . we present a question answering framework \( barqa \) for this task , which leverages the power of transfer learning. furthermore , we propose a novel method to generate a large amount of “quasi-bridging” training data. we show that our model pre-trained on this dataset and fine-tuned on a small amount of in-domain dataset achieves new state-of-the-art results for bridging anaphora resolution on two bridging corpora \( isnotes \( markert et al. , 2012 \) and bashi \( ro ̈siger , 2018 \) \) .
