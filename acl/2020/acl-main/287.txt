ECPE-2D: Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction based on Joint Two-Dimensional Representation, Interaction and Prediction | Zixiang Ding | in recent years , a new interesting task , called emotion-cause pair extraction \( ecpe \) , has emerged in the area of text emotion analysis. it aims at extracting the potential pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes in a document. to solve this task , the existing research employed a two-step framework , which first extracts individual emotion set and cause set , and then pair the corresponding emotions and causes. however , such a pipeline of two steps contains some inherent flaws: 1 \) the modeling does not aim at extracting the final emotion-cause pair directly; 2 \) the errors from the first step will affect the performance of the second step. to address these shortcomings , in this paper we propose a new end-to-end approach , called ecpe-two-dimensional \( ecpe-2d \) , to represent the emotion-cause pairs by a 2d representation scheme. a 2d transformer module and two variants , window-constrained and cross-road 2d transformers , are further proposed to model the interactions of different emotion-cause pairs. the 2d representation , interaction , and prediction are integrated into a joint framework. in addition to the advantages of joint modeling , the experimental results on the benchmark emotion cause corpus show that our approach improves the f1 score of the state-of-the-art from 61.28% to 68.89%.
