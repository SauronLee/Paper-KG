Towards end-2-end learning for predicting behavior codes from spoken utterances in psychotherapy conversations | Karan Singla | spoken language understanding tasks usually rely on pipelines involving complex processing blocks such as voice activity detection , speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition \( asr \) . we propose a novel framework for predicting utterance level labels directly from speech features , thus removing the dependency on first generating transcripts , and transcription free behavioral coding. our classifier uses a pretrained speech-2-vector encoder as bottleneck to generate word-level representations from speech features. this pretrained encoder learns to encode speech features for a word using an objective similar to word2vec. our proposed approach just uses speech features and word segmentation information for predicting spoken utterance-level target labels. we show that our model achieves competitive results to other state-of-the-art approaches which use transcribed text for the task of predicting psychotherapy-relevant behavior codes.
