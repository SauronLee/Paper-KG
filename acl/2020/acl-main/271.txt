Zero-shot Text Classification via Reinforced Self-training | Zhiquan Ye | zero-shot learning has been a tough problem since no labeled data is available for unseen classes during training , especially for classes with low similarity. in this situation , transferring from seen classes to unseen classes is extremely hard. to tackle this problem , in this paper we propose a self-training based method to efficiently leverage unlabeled data. traditional self-training methods use fixed heuristics to select instances from unlabeled data , whose performance varies among different datasets. we propose a reinforcement learning framework to learn data selection strategy automatically and provide more reliable selection. experimental results on both benchmarks and a real-world e-commerce dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in zero-shot text classification
