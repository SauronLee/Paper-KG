Improving Multimodal Named Entity Recognition via Entity Span Detection with Unified Multimodal Transformer | Jianfei Yu | in this paper , we study multimodal named entity recognition \( mner \) for social media posts. existing approaches for mner mainly suffer from two drawbacks: \( 1 \) despite generating word-aware visual representations , their word representations are insensitive to the visual context; \( 2 \) most of them ignore the bias brought by the visual context. to tackle the first issue , we propose a multimodal interaction module to obtain both image-aware word representations and word-aware visual representations. to alleviate the visual bias , we further propose to leverage purely text-based entity span detection as an auxiliary module , and design a unified multimodal transformer to guide the final predictions with the entity span predictions. experiments show that our unified approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.
