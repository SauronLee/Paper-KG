Improving Event Detection via Open-domain Trigger Knowledge | Meihan Tong | event detection \( ed \) is a fundamental task in automatically structuring texts. due to the small scale of training data , previous methods perform poorly on unseen/sparsely labeled trigger words and are prone to overfitting densely labeled trigger words. to address the issue , we propose a novel enrichment knowledge distillation \( ekd \) model to leverage external open-domain trigger knowledge to reduce the in-built biases to frequent trigger words in annotations. experiments on benchmark ace2005 show that our model outperforms nine strong baselines , is especially effective for unseen/sparsely labeled trigger words. the source code is released on https://github.com/shuaiwa16/ekd.git.
