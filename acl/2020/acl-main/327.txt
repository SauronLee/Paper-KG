ChartDialogs: Plotting from Natural Language Instructions | Yutong Shao | this paper presents the problem of conversational plotting agents that carry out plotting actions from natural language instructions. to facilitate the development of such agents , we introduce chartdialogs , a new multi-turn dialog dataset , covering a popular plotting library , matplotlib. the dataset contains over 15 , 000 dialog turns from 3 , 200 dialogs covering the majority of matplotlib plot types. extensive experiments show the best-performing method achieving 61% plotting accuracy , demonstrating that the dataset presents a non-trivial challenge for future research on this task.
