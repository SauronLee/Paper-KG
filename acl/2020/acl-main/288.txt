Effective Inter-Clause Modeling for End-to-End Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction | Penghui Wei | emotion-cause pair extraction aims to extract all emotion clauses coupled with their cause clauses from a given document. previous work employs two-step approaches , in which the first step extracts emotion clauses and cause clauses separately , and the second step trains a classifier to filter out negative pairs. however , such pipeline-style system for emotion-cause pair extraction is suboptimal because it suffers from error propagation and the two steps may not adapt to each other well. in this paper , we tackle emotion-cause pair extraction from a ranking perspective , i.e. , ranking clause pair candidates in a document , and propose a one-step neural approach which emphasizes inter-clause modeling to perform end-to-end extraction. it models the interrelations between the clauses in a document to learn clause representations with graph attention , and enhances clause pair representations with kernel-based relative position embedding for effective ranking. experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the current two-step systems , especially in the condition of extracting multiple pairs in one document.
