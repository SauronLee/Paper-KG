Improved Natural Language Generation via Loss Truncation | Daniel Kang | neural language models are usually trained to match the distributional properties of large-scale corpora by minimizing the log loss. while straightforward to optimize , this approach forces the model to reproduce all variations in the dataset , including noisy and invalid references \( e.g. , misannotations and hallucinated facts \) . even a small fraction of noisy data can degrade the performance of log loss. as an alternative , prior work has shown that minimizing the distinguishability of generated samples is a principled and robust loss that can handle invalid references. however , distinguishability has not been used in practice due to challenges in optimization and estimation. we propose loss truncation: a simple and scalable procedure which adaptively removes high log loss examples as a way to optimize for distinguishability. empirically , we demonstrate that loss truncation outperforms existing baselines on distinguishability on a summarization task. furthermore , we show that samples generated by the loss truncation model have factual accuracy ratings that exceed those of baselines and match human references.
