Semantic Scaffolds for Pseudocode-to-Code Generation | Ruiqi Zhong | we propose a method for program generation based on semantic scaffolds , lightweight structures representing the high-level semantic and syntactic composition of a program. by first searching over plausible scaffolds then using these as constraints for a beam search over programs , we achieve better coverage of the search space when compared with existing techniques. we apply our hierarchical search method to the spoc dataset for pseudocode-to-code generation , in which we are given line-level natural language pseudocode annotations and aim to produce a program satisfying execution-based test cases. by using semantic scaffolds during inference , we achieve a 10% absolute improvement in top-100 accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art. additionally , we require only 11 candidates to reach the top-3000 performance of the previous best approach when tested against unseen problems , demonstrating a substantial improvement in efficiency.
