Towards Open Domain Event Trigger Identification using Adversarial Domain Adaptation | Aakanksha Naik | we tackle the task of building supervised event trigger identification models which can generalize better across domains. our work leverages the adversarial domain adaptation \( ada \) framework to introduce domain-invariance. ada uses adversarial training to construct representations that are predictive for trigger identification , but not predictive of the exampleâ€™s domain. it requires no labeled data from the target domain , making it completely unsupervised. experiments with two domains \( english literature and news \) show that ada leads to an average f1 score improvement of 3.9 on out-of-domain data. our best performing model \( bert-a \) reaches 44-49 f1 across both domains , using no labeled target data. preliminary experiments reveal that finetuning on 1% labeled data , followed by self-training leads to substantial improvement , reaching 51.5 and 67.2 f1 on literature and news respectively.
