NeuInfer: Knowledge Inference on N-ary Facts | Saiping Guan | knowledge inference on knowledge graph has attracted extensive attention , which aims to find out connotative valid facts in knowledge graph and is very helpful for improving the performance of many downstream applications. however , researchers have mainly poured attention to knowledge inference on binary facts. the studies on n-ary facts are relatively scarcer , although they are also ubiquitous in the real world. therefore , this paper addresses knowledge inference on n-ary facts. we represent each n-ary fact as a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary descriptive attribute-value pair \( s \) . we further propose a neural network model , neuinfer , for knowledge inference on n-ary facts. besides handling the common task to infer an unknown element in a whole fact , neuinfer can cope with a new type of task , flexible knowledge inference. it aims to infer an unknown element in a partial fact consisting of the primary triple coupled with any number of its auxiliary description \( s \) . experimental results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of neuinfer.
