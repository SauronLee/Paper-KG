Investigating the effect of auxiliary objectives for the automated grading of learner English speech transcriptions | Hannah Craighead | we address the task of automatically grading the language proficiency of spontaneous speech based on textual features from automatic speech recognition transcripts. motivated by recent advances in multi-task learning , we develop neural networks trained in a multi-task fashion that learn to predict the proficiency level of non-native english speakers by taking advantage of inductive transfer between the main task \( grading \) and auxiliary prediction tasks: morpho-syntactic labeling , language modeling , and native language identification \( l1 \) . we encode the transcriptions with both bi-directional recurrent neural networks and with bi-directional representations from transformers , compare against a feature-rich baseline , and analyse performance at different proficiency levels and with transcriptions of varying error rates. our best performance comes from a transformer encoder with l1 prediction as an auxiliary task. we discuss areas for improvement and potential applications for text-only speech scoring.
