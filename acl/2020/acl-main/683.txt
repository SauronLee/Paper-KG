Learning Web-based Procedures by Reasoning over Explanations and Demonstrations in Context | Shashank Srivastava | we explore learning web-based tasks from a human teacher through natural language explanations and a single demonstration. our approach investigates a new direction for semantic parsing that models explaining a demonstration in a context , rather than mapping explanations to demonstrations. by leveraging the idea of inverse semantics from program synthesis to reason backwards from observed demonstrations , we ensure that all considered interpretations are consistent with executable actions in any context , thus simplifying the problem of search over logical forms. we present a dataset of explanations paired with demonstrations for web-based tasks. our methods show better task completion rates than a supervised semantic parsing baseline \( 40% relative improvement on average \) , and are competitive with simple exploration-and-demonstration based methods , while requiring no exploration of the environment. in learning to align explanations with demonstrations , basic properties of natural language syntax emerge as learned behavior. this is an interesting example of pragmatic language acquisition without any linguistic annotation.
