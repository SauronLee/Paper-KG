Diversifying Dialogue Generation with Non-Conversational Text | Hui Su | neural network-based sequence-to-sequence \( seq2seq \) models strongly suffer from the low-diversity problem when it comes to open-domain dialogue generation. as bland and generic utterances usually dominate the frequency distribution in our daily chitchat , avoiding them to generate more interesting responses requires complex data filtering , sampling techniques or modifying the training objective. in this paper , we propose a new perspective to diversify dialogue generation by leveraging
