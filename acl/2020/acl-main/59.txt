Paraphrase Augmented Task-Oriented Dialog Generation | Silin Gao | neural generative models have achieved promising performance on dialog generation tasks if given a huge data set. however , the lack of high-quality dialog data and the expensive data annotation process greatly limit their application in real world settings. we propose a paraphrase augmented response generation \( parg \) framework that jointly trains a paraphrase model and a response generation model to improve the dialog generation performance. we also design a method to automatically construct paraphrase training data set based on dialog state and dialog act labels. parg is applicable to various dialog generation models , such as tscp \( lei et al. , 2018 \) and damd \( zhang et al. , 2019 \) . experimental results show that the proposed framework improves these state-of-the-art dialog models further on camrest676 and multiwoz. parg also outperforms other data augmentation methods significantly in dialog generation tasks , especially under low resource settings.
