Relational Graph Attention Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis | Kai Wang | aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards a specific aspect in online reviews. most recent efforts adopt attention-based neural network models to implicitly connect aspects with opinion words. however , due to the complexity of language and the existence of multiple aspects in a single sentence , these models often confuse the connections. in this paper , we address this problem by means of effective encoding of syntax information. firstly , we define a unified aspect-oriented dependency tree structure rooted at a target aspect by reshaping and pruning an ordinary dependency parse tree. then , we propose a relational graph attention network \( r-gat \) to encode the new tree structure for sentiment prediction. extensive experiments are conducted on the semeval 2014 and twitter datasets , and the experimental results confirm that the connections between aspects and opinion words can be better established with our approach , and the performance of the graph attention network \( gat \) is significantly improved as a consequence.
