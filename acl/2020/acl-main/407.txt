ERASER: A Benchmark to Evaluate Rationalized NLP Models | Jay DeYoung | state-of-the-art models in nlp are now predominantly based on deep neural networks that are opaque in terms of how they come to make predictions. this limitation has increased interest in designing more interpretable deep models for nlp that reveal the ‘reasoning’ behind model outputs. but work in this direction has been conducted on different datasets and tasks with correspondingly unique aims and metrics; this makes it difficult to track progress. we propose the
