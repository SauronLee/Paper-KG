How to Ask Good Questions? Try to Leverage Paraphrases | Xin Jia | given a sentence and its relevant answer , how to ask good questions is a challenging task , which has many real applications. inspired by humanâ€™s paraphrasing capability to ask questions of the same meaning but with diverse expressions , we propose to incorporate paraphrase knowledge into question generation \( qg \) to generate human-like questions. specifically , we present a two-hand hybrid model leveraging a self-built paraphrase resource , which is automatically conducted by a simple back-translation method. on the one hand , we conduct multi-task learning with sentence-level paraphrase generation \( pg \) as an auxiliary task to supplement paraphrase knowledge to the task-share encoder. on the other hand , we adopt a new loss function for diversity training to introduce more question patterns to qg. extensive experimental results show that our proposed model obtains obvious performance gain over several strong baselines , and further human evaluation validates that our model can ask questions of high quality by leveraging paraphrase knowledge.
