From Zero to Hero: Human-In-The-Loop Entity Linking in Low Resource Domains | Jan-Christoph Klie | entity linking \( el \) is concerned with disambiguating entity mentions in a text against knowledge bases \( kb \) . it is crucial in a considerable number of fields like humanities , technical writing and biomedical sciences to enrich texts with semantics and discover more knowledge. the use of el in such domains requires handling noisy texts , low resource settings and domain-specific kbs. existing approaches are mostly inappropriate for this , as they depend on training data. however , in the above scenario , there exists hardly annotated data , and it needs to be created from scratch. we therefore present a novel domain-agnostic human-in-the-loop annotation approach: we use recommenders that suggest potential concepts and adaptive candidate ranking , thereby speeding up the overall annotation process and making it less tedious for users. we evaluate our ranking approach in a simulation on difficult texts and show that it greatly outperforms a strong baseline in ranking accuracy. in a user study , the annotation speed improves by 35% compared to annotating without interactive support; users report that they strongly prefer our system. an open-source and ready-to-use implementation based on the text annotation platform inception \( https://inception-project.github.io \) is made available.
