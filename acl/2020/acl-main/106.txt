Building a User-Generated Content North-African Arabizi Treebank: Tackling Hell | Djam√© Seddah | we introduce the first treebank for a romanized user-generated content variety of algerian , a north-african arabic dialect known for its frequent usage of code-switching. made of 1500 sentences , fully annotated in morpho-syntax and universal dependency syntax , with full translation at both the word and the sentence levels , this treebank is made freely available. it is supplemented with 50k unlabeled sentences collected from common crawl and web-crawled data using intensive data-mining techniques. preliminary experiments demonstrate its usefulness for pos tagging and dependency parsing. we believe that what we present in this paper is useful beyond the low-resource language community. this is the first time that enough unlabeled and annotated data is provided for an emerging user-generated content dialectal language with rich morphology and code switching , making it an challenging test-bed for most recent nlp approaches.
