Grounded Conversation Generation as Guided Traverses in Commonsense Knowledge Graphs | Houyu Zhang | human conversations naturally evolve around related concepts and hop to distant concepts. this paper presents a new conversation generation model , conceptflow , which leverages commonsense knowledge graphs to explicitly model conversation flows. by grounding conversations to the concept space , conceptflow represents the potential conversation flow as traverses in the concept space along commonsense relations. the traverse is guided by graph attentions in the concept graph , moving towards more meaningful directions in the concept space , in order to generate more semantic and informative responses. experiments on reddit conversations demonstrate conceptflowâ€™s effectiveness over previous knowledge-aware conversation models and gpt-2 based models while using 70% fewer parameters , confirming the advantage of explicit modeling conversation structures. all source codes of this work are available at https://github.com/thunlp/conceptflow.
