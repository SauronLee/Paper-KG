Two Birds, One Stone: A Simple, Unified Model for Text Generation from Structured and Unstructured Data | Hamidreza Shahidi | a number of researchers have recently questioned the necessity of increasingly complex neural network \( nn \) architectures. in particular , several recent papers have shown that simpler , properly tuned models are at least competitive across several nlp tasks. in this work , we show that this is also the case for text generation from structured and unstructured data. we consider neural table-to-text generation and neural question generation \( nqg \) tasks for text generation from structured and unstructured data , respectively. table-to-text generation aims to generate a description based on a given table , and nqg is the task of generating a question from a given passage where the generated question can be answered by a certain sub-span of the passage using nn models. experimental results demonstrate that a basic attention-based seq2seq model trained with the exponential moving average technique achieves the state of the art in both tasks. code is available at https://github.com/h-shahidi/2birds-gen.
