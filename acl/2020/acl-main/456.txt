Knowledge Graph-Augmented Abstractive Summarization with Semantic-Driven Cloze Reward | Luyang Huang | sequence-to-sequence models for abstractive summarization have been studied extensively , yet the generated summaries commonly suffer from fabricated content , and are often found to be near-extractive. we argue that , to address these issues , the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input , e.g. , via structured representation , to allow the generation of more informative summaries. in this paper , we present asgard , a novel framework for abstractive summarization with graph-augmentation and semantic-driven reward. we propose the use of dual encoders—a sequential document encoder and a graph-structured encoder—to maintain the global context and local characteristics of entities , complementing each other. we further design a reward based on a multiple choice cloze test to drive the model to better capture entity interactions. results show that our models produce significantly higher rouge scores than a variant without knowledge graph as input on both new york times and cnn/daily mail datasets. we also obtain better or comparable performance compared to systems that are fine-tuned from large pretrained language models. human judges further rate our model outputs as more informative and containing fewer unfaithful errors.
