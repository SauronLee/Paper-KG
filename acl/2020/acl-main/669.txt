SciREX: A Challenge Dataset for Document-Level Information Extraction | Sarthak Jain | extracting information from full documents is an important problem in many domains , but most previous work focus on identifying relationships within a sentence or a paragraph. it is challenging to create a large-scale information extraction \( ie \) dataset at the document level since it requires an understanding of the whole document to annotate entities and their document-level relationships that usually span beyond sentences or even sections. in this paper , we introduce scirex , a document level ie dataset that encompasses multiple ie tasks , including salient entity identification and document level n-ary relation identification from scientific articles. we annotate our dataset by integrating automatic and human annotations , leveraging existing scientific knowledge resources. we develop a neural model as a strong baseline that extends previous state-of-the-art ie models to document-level ie. analyzing the model performance shows a significant gap between human performance and current baselines , inviting the community to use our dataset as a challenge to develop document-level ie models. our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/allenai/scirex .
