Bootstrapping Techniques for Polysynthetic Morphological Analysis | William Lane | polysynthetic languages have exceptionally large and sparse vocabularies , thanks to the number of morpheme slots and combinations in a word. this complexity , together with a general scarcity of written data , poses a challenge to the development of natural language technologies. to address this challenge , we offer linguistically-informed approaches for bootstrapping a neural morphological analyzer , and demonstrate its application to kunwinjku , a polysynthetic australian language. we generate data from a finite state transducer to train an encoder-decoder model. we improve the model by “hallucinating” missing linguistic structure into the training data , and by resampling from a zipf distribution to simulate a more natural distribution of morphemes. the best model accounts for all instances of reduplication in the test set and achieves an accuracy of 94.7% overall , a 10 percentage point improvement over the fst baseline. this process demonstrates the feasibility of bootstrapping a neural morph analyzer from minimal resources.
