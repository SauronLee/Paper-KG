Template-Based Question Generation from Retrieved Sentences for Improved Unsupervised Question Answering | Alexander Fabbri | question answering \( qa \) is in increasing demand as the amount of information available online and the desire for quick access to this content grows. a common approach to qa has been to fine-tune a pretrained language model on a task-specific labeled dataset. this paradigm , however , relies on scarce , and costly to obtain , large-scale human-labeled data. we propose an unsupervised approach to training qa models with generated pseudo-training data. we show that generating questions for qa training by applying a simple template on a related , retrieved sentence rather than the original context sentence improves downstream qa performance by allowing the model to learn more complex context-question relationships. training a qa model on this data gives a relative improvement over a previous unsupervised model in f1 score on the squad dataset by about 14% , and 20% when the answer is a named entity , achieving state-of-the-art performance on squad for unsupervised qa.
