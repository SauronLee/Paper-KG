Tchebycheff Procedure for Multi-task Text Classification | Yuren Mao | multi-task learning methods have achieved great progress in text classification. however , existing methods assume that multi-task text classification problems are convex multiobjective optimization problems , which is unrealistic in real-world applications. to address this issue , this paper presents a novel tchebycheff procedure to optimize the multi-task classification problems without convex assumption. the extensive experiments back up our theoretical analysis and validate the superiority of our proposals.
