TAG : Type Auxiliary Guiding for Code Comment Generation | Ruichu Cai | existing leading code comment generation approaches with the structure-to-sequence framework ignores the type information of the interpretation of the code , e.g. , operator , string , etc. however , introducing the type information into the existing framework is non-trivial due to the hierarchical dependence among the type information. in order to address the issues above , we propose a type auxiliary guiding encoder-decoder framework for the code comment generation task which considers the source code as an n-ary tree with type information associated with each node. specifically , our framework is featured with a type-associated encoder and a type-restricted decoder which enables adaptive summarization of the source code. we further propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method to resolve the training difficulties of our proposed framework. extensive evaluations demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework with both the auto-evaluated metrics and case studies.
