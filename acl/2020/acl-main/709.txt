One Size Does Not Fit All: Generating and Evaluating Variable Number of Keyphrases | Xingdi Yuan | different texts shall by nature correspond to different number of keyphrases. this desideratum is largely missing from existing neural keyphrase generation models. in this study , we address this problem from both modeling and evaluation perspectives. we first propose a recurrent generative model that generates multiple keyphrases as delimiter-separated sequences. generation diversity is further enhanced with two novel techniques by manipulating decoder hidden states. in contrast to previous approaches , our model is capable of generating diverse keyphrases and controlling number of outputs. we further propose two evaluation metrics tailored towards the variable-number generation. we also introduce a new dataset stackex that expands beyond the only existing genre \( i.e. , academic writing \) in keyphrase generation tasks. with both previous and new evaluation metrics , our model outperforms strong baselines on all datasets.
