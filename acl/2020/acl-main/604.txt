Parsing into Variable-in-situ Logico-Semantic Graphs | Yufei Chen | we propose variable-in-situ logico-semantic graphs to bridge the gap between semantic graph and logical form parsing. the new type of graph-based meaning representation allows us to include analysis for scope-related phenomena , such as quantification , negation and modality , in a way that is consistent with the state-of-the-art underspecification approach. moreover , the well-formedness of such a graph is clear , since model-theoretic interpretation is available. we demonstrate the effectiveness of this new perspective by developing a new state-of-the-art semantic parser for english resource semantics. at the core of this parser is a novel neural graph rewriting system which combines the strengths of hyperedge replacement grammar , a knowledge-intensive model , and graph neural networks , a data-intensive model. our parser achieves an accuracy of 92.39% in terms of elementary dependency match , which is a 2.88 point improvement over the best data-driven model in the literature. the output of our parser is highly coherent: at least 91% graphs are valid , in that they allow at least one sound scope-resolved logical form.
