End-to-End Neural Pipeline for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems using GPT-2 | Donghoon Ham | the goal-oriented dialogue system needs to be optimized for tracking the dialogue flow and carrying out an effective conversation under various situations to meet the user goal. the traditional approach to build such a dialogue system is to take a pipelined modular architecture , where its modules are optimized individually. however , such an optimization scheme does not necessarily yield the overall performance improvement of the whole system. on the other hand , end-to-end dialogue systems with monolithic neural architecture are often trained only with input-output utterances , without taking into account the entire annotations available in the corpus. this scheme makes it difficult for goal-oriented dialogues where the system needs to integrate with external systems or to provide interpretable information about why the system generated a particular response. in this paper , we present an end-to-end neural architecture for dialogue systems that addresses both challenges above. in the human evaluation , our dialogue system achieved the success rate of 68.32% , the language understanding score of 4.149 , and the response appropriateness score of 4.287 , which ranked the system at the top position in the end-to-end multi-domain dialogue system task in the 8th dialogue systems technology challenge \( dstc8 \) .
