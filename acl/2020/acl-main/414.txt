A Corpus for Large-Scale Phonetic Typology | Elizabeth Salesky | a major hurdle in data-driven research on typology is having sufficient data in many languages to draw meaningful conclusions. we present voxclamantis v1.0 , the first large-scale corpus for phonetic typology , with aligned segments and estimated phoneme-level labels in 690 readings spanning 635 languages , along with acoustic-phonetic measures of vowels and sibilants. access to such data can greatly facilitate investigation of phonetic typology at a large scale and across many languages. however , it is non-trivial and computationally intensive to obtain such alignments for hundreds of languages , many of which have few to no resources presently available. we describe the methodology to create our corpus , discuss caveats with current methods and their impact on the utility of this data , and illustrate possible research directions through a series of case studies on the 48 highest-quality readings. our corpus and scripts are publicly available for non-commercial use at https://voxclamantisproject.github.io.
