2kenize: Tying Subword Sequences for Chinese Script Conversion | Pranav A | simplified chinese to traditional chinese character conversion is a common preprocessing step in chinese nlp. despite this , current approaches have insufficient performance because they do not take into account that a simplified chinese character can correspond to multiple traditional characters. here , we propose a model that can disambiguate between mappings and convert between the two scripts. the model is based on subword segmentation , two language models , as well as a method for mapping between subword sequences. we further construct benchmark datasets for topic classification and script conversion. our proposed method outperforms previous chinese character conversion approaches by 6 points in accuracy. these results are further confirmed in a downstream application , where 2kenize is used to convert pretraining dataset for topic classification. an error analysis reveals that our methodâ€™s particular strengths are in dealing with code mixing and named entities.
