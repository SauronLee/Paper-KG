Examining Citations of Natural Language Processing Literature | Saif M. Mohammad | we extracted information from the acl anthology \( aa \) and google scholar \( gs \) to examine trends in citations of nlp papers. we explore questions such as: how well cited are papers of different types \( journal articles , conference papers , demo papers , etc. \) \? how well cited are papers from different areas of within nlp \? etc. notably , we show that only about 56% of the papers in aa are cited ten or more times. cl journal has the most cited papers , but its citation dominance has lessened in recent years. on average , long papers get almost three times as many citations as short papers; and papers on sentiment classification , anaphora resolution , and entity recognition have the highest median citations. the analyses presented here , and the associated dataset of nlp papers mapped to citations , have a number of uses including: understanding how the field is growing and quantifying the impact of different types of papers.
