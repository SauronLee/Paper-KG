Pyramid: A Layered Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition | Jue Wang | this paper presents pyramid , a novel layered model for nested named entity recognition \( nested ner \) . in our approach , token or text region embeddings are recursively inputted into l flat ner layers , from bottom to top , stacked in a pyramid shape. each time an embedding passes through a layer of the pyramid , its length is reduced by one. its hidden state at layer l represents an l-gram in the input text , which is labeled only if its corresponding text region represents a complete entity mention. we also design an inverse pyramid to allow bidirectional interaction between layers. the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art f1 scores in nested ner on ace-2004 , ace-2005 , genia , and nne , which are 80.27 , 79.42 , 77.78 , and 93.70 with conventional embeddings , and 87.74 , 86.34 , 79.31 , and 94.68 with pre-trained contextualized embeddings. in addition , our model can be used for the more general task of overlapping named entity recognition. a preliminary experiment confirms the effectiveness of our method in overlapping ner.
