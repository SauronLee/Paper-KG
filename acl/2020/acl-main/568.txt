A Top-down Neural Architecture towards Text-level Parsing of Discourse Rhetorical Structure | Longyin Zhang | due to its great importance in deep natural language understanding and various down-stream applications , text-level parsing of discourse rhetorical structure \( drs \) has been drawing more and more attention in recent years. however , all the previous studies on text-level discourse parsing adopt bottom-up approaches , which much limit the drs determination on local information and fail to well benefit from global information of the overall discourse. in this paper , we justify from both computational and perceptive points-of-view that the top-down architecture is more suitable for text-level drs parsing. on the basis , we propose a top-down neural architecture toward text-level drs parsing. in particular , we cast discourse parsing as a recursive split point ranking task , where a split point is classified to different levels according to its rank and the elementary discourse units \( edus \) associated with it are arranged accordingly. in this way , we can determine the complete drs as a hierarchical tree structure via an encoder-decoder with an internal stack. experimentation on both the english rst-dt corpus and the chinese cdtb corpus shows the great effectiveness of our proposed top-down approach towards text-level drs parsing.
