Hyperbolic Capsule Networks for Multi-Label Classification | Boli Chen | although deep neural networks are effective at extracting high-level features , classification methods usually encode an input into a vector representation via simple feature aggregation operations \( e.g. pooling \) . such operations limit the performance. for instance , a multi-label document may contain several concepts. in this case , one vector can not sufficiently capture its salient and discriminative content. thus , we propose hyperbolic capsule networks \( hypercaps \) for multi-label classification \( mlc \) , which have two merits. first , hyperbolic capsules are designed to capture fine-grained document information for each label , which has the ability to characterize complicated structures among labels and documents. second , hyperbolic dynamic routing \( hdr \) is introduced to aggregate hyperbolic capsules in a label-aware manner , so that the label-level discriminative information can be preserved along the depth of neural networks. to efficiently handle large-scale mlc datasets , we additionally present a new routing method to adaptively adjust the capsule number during routing. extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets. compared with the state-of-the-art methods , hypercaps significantly improves the performance of mlc especially on tail labels.
