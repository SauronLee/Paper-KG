Optimizing the Factual Correctness of a Summary: A Study of Summarizing Radiology Reports | Yuhao Zhang | neural abstractive summarization models are able to generate summaries which have high overlap with human references. however , existing models are not optimized for factual correctness , a critical metric in real-world applications. in this work , we develop a general framework where we evaluate the factual correctness of a generated summary by fact-checking it automatically against its reference using an information extraction module. we further propose a training strategy which optimizes a neural summarization model with a factual correctness reward via reinforcement learning. we apply the proposed method to the summarization of radiology reports , where factual correctness is a key requirement. on two separate datasets collected from hospitals , we show via both automatic and human evaluation that the proposed approach substantially improves the factual correctness and overall quality of outputs over a competitive neural summarization system , producing radiology summaries that approach the quality of human-authored ones.
