PeTra: A Sparsely Supervised Memory Model for People Tracking | Shubham Toshniwal | we propose petra , a memory-augmented neural network designed to track entities in its memory slots. petra is trained using sparse annotation from the gap pronoun resolution dataset and outperforms a prior memory model on the task while using a simpler architecture. we empirically compare key modeling choices , finding that we can simplify several aspects of the design of the memory module while retaining strong performance. to measure the people tracking capability of memory models , we \( a \) propose a new diagnostic evaluation based on counting the number of unique entities in text , and \( b \) conduct a small scale human evaluation to compare evidence of people tracking in the memory logs of petra relative to a previous approach. petra is highly effective in both evaluations , demonstrating its ability to track people in its memory despite being trained with limited annotation.
