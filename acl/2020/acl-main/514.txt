Diverse and Informative Dialogue Generation with Context-Specific Commonsense Knowledge Awareness | Sixing Wu | generative dialogue systems tend to produce generic responses , which often leads to boring conversations. for alleviating this issue , recent studies proposed to retrieve and introduce knowledge facts from knowledge graphs. while this paradigm works to a certain extent , it usually retrieves knowledge facts only based on the entity word itself , without considering the specific dialogue context. thus , the introduction of the context-irrelevant knowledge facts can impact the quality of generations. to this end , this paper proposes a novel commonsense knowledge-aware dialogue generation model , conkadi. we design a felicitous fact mechanism to help the model focus on the knowledge facts that are highly relevant to the context; furthermore , two techniques , context-knowledge fusion and flexible mode fusion are proposed to facilitate the integration of the knowledge in the conkadi. we collect and build a large-scale chinese dataset aligned with the commonsense knowledge for dialogue generation. extensive evaluations over both an open-released english dataset and our chinese dataset demonstrate that our approach conkadi outperforms the state-of-the-art approach ccm , in most experiments.
