Learning Low-Resource End-To-End Goal-Oriented Dialog for Fast and Reliable System Deployment | Yinpei Dai | existing end-to-end dialog systems perform less effectively when data is scarce. to obtain an acceptable success in real-life online services with only a handful of training examples , both fast adaptability and reliable performance are highly desirable for dialog systems. in this paper , we propose the meta-dialog system \( mds \) , which combines the advantages of both meta-learning approaches and human-machine collaboration. we evaluate our methods on a new extended-babi dataset and a transformed multiwoz dataset for low-resource goal-oriented dialog learning. experimental results show that mds significantly outperforms non-meta-learning baselines and can achieve more than 90% per-turn accuracies with only 10 dialogs on the extended-babi dataset.
