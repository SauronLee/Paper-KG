MMPE: A Multi-Modal Interface for Post-Editing Machine Translation | Nico Herbig | current advances in machine translation \( mt \) increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing \( pe \) of machine-translated text , a process that saves time and reduces errors. this affects the design of translation interfaces , as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. since this paradigm shift offers potential for modalities other than mouse and keyboard , we present mmpe , the first prototype to combine traditional input modes with pen , touch , and speech modalities for pe of mt. the results of an evaluation with professional translators suggest that pen and touch interaction are suitable for deletion and reordering tasks , while they are of limited use for longer insertions. on the other hand , speech and multi-modal combinations of select & speech are considered suitable for replacements and insertions but offer less potential for deletion and reordering. overall , participants were enthusiastic about the new modalities and saw them as good extensions to mouse & keyboard , but not as a complete substitute.
