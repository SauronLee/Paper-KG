KdConv: A Chinese Multi-domain Dialogue Dataset Towards Multi-turn Knowledge-driven Conversation | Hao Zhou | the research of knowledge-driven conversational systems is largely limited due to the lack of dialog data which consists of multi-turn conversations on multiple topics and with knowledge annotations. in this paper , we propose a chinese multi-domain knowledge-driven conversation dataset , kdconv , which grounds the topics in multi-turn conversations to knowledge graphs. our corpus contains 4.5k conversations from three domains \( film , music , and travel \) , and 86k utterances with an average turn number of 19.0. these conversations contain in-depth discussions on related topics and natural transition between multiple topics. to facilitate the following research on this corpus , we provide several benchmark models. comparative results show that the models can be enhanced by introducing background knowledge , yet there is still a large space for leveraging knowledge to model multi-turn conversations for further research. results also show that there are obvious performance differences between different domains , indicating that it is worth further explore transfer learning and domain adaptation. the corpus and benchmark models are publicly available.
