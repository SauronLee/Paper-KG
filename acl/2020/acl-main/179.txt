Speakers enhance contextually confusable words | Eric Meinhardt | recent work has found evidence that natural languages are shaped by pressures for efficient communication — e.g. the more contextually predictable a word is , the fewer speech sounds or syllables it has \( piantadosi et al. 2011 \) . research on the degree to which speech and language are shaped by pressures for effective communication — robustness in the face of noise and uncertainty — has been more equivocal. we develop a measure of contextual confusability during word recognition based on psychoacoustic data. applying this measure to naturalistic speech corpora , we find evidence suggesting that speakers alter their productions to make contextually more confusable words easier to understand.
