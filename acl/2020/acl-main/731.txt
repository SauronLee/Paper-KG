A Multitask Learning Approach for Diacritic Restoration | Sawsan Alqahtani | in many languages like arabic , diacritics are used to specify pronunciations as well as meanings. such diacritics are often omitted in written text , increasing the number of possible pronunciations and meanings for a word. this results in a more ambiguous text making computational processing on such text more difficult. diacritic restoration is the task of restoring missing diacritics in the written text. most state-of-the-art diacritic restoration models are built on character level information which helps generalize the model to unseen data , but presumably lose useful information at the word level. thus , to compensate for this loss , we investigate the use of multi-task learning to jointly optimize diacritic restoration with related nlp problems namely word segmentation , part-of-speech tagging , and syntactic diacritization. we use arabic as a case study since it has sufficient data resources for tasks that we consider in our joint modeling. our joint models significantly outperform the baselines and are comparable to the state-of-the-art models that are more complex relying on morphological analyzers and/or a lot more data \( e.g. dialectal data \) .
