Learning Interpretable Relationships between Entities, Relations and Concepts via Bayesian Structure Learning on Open Domain Facts | Jingyuan Zhang | concept graphs are created as universal taxonomies for text understanding in the open-domain knowledge. the nodes in concept graphs include both entities and concepts. the edges are from entities to concepts , showing that an entity is an instance of a concept. in this paper , we propose the task of learning interpretable relationships from open-domain facts to enrich and refine concept graphs. the bayesian network structures are learned from open-domain facts as the interpretable relationships between relations of facts and concepts of entities. we conduct extensive experiments on public english and chinese datasets. compared to the state-of-the-art methods , the learned network structures help improving the identification of concepts for entities based on the relations of entities on both datasets.
