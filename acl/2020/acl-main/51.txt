CDL: Curriculum Dual Learning for Emotion-Controllable Response Generation | Lei Shen | emotion-controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task that aims to make open-domain conversations more empathetic and engaging. existing methods mainly enhance the emotion expression by adding regularization terms to standard cross-entropy loss and thus influence the training process. however , due to the lack of further consideration of content consistency , the common problem of response generation tasks , safe response , is intensified. besides , query emotions that can help model the relationship between query and response are simply ignored in previous models , which would further hurt the coherence. to alleviate these problems , we propose a novel framework named curriculum dual learning \( cdl \) which extends the emotion-controllable response generation to a dual task to generate emotional responses and emotional queries alternatively. cdl utilizes two rewards focusing on emotion and content to improve the duality. additionally , it applies curriculum learning to gradually generate high-quality responses based on the difficulties of expressing various emotions. experimental results show that cdl significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of coherence , diversity , and relation to emotion factors.
