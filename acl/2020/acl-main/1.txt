Predicting Depression in Screening Interviews from Latent Categorization of Interview Prompts | Alex Rinaldi | accurately diagnosing depression is difficultâ€“ requiring time-intensive interviews , assessments , and analysis. hence , automated methods that can assess linguistic patterns in these interviews could help psychiatric professionals make faster , more informed decisions about diagnosis. we propose jlpc , a model that analyzes interview transcripts to identify depression while jointly categorizing interview prompts into latent categories. this latent categorization allows the model to define high-level conversational contexts that influence patterns of language in depressed individuals. we show that the proposed model not only outperforms competitive baselines , but that its latent prompt categories provide psycholinguistic insights about depression.
