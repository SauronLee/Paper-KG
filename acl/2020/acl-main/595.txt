Modeling Morphological Typology for Unsupervised Learning of Language Morphology | Hongzhi Xu | this paper describes a language-independent model for fully unsupervised morphological analysis that exploits a universal framework leveraging morphological typology. by modeling morphological processes including suffixation , prefixation , infixation , and full and partial reduplication with constrained stem change rules , our system effectively constrains the search space and offers a wide coverage in terms of morphological typology. the system is tested on nine typologically and genetically diverse languages , and shows superior performance over leading systems. we also investigate the effect of an oracle that provides only a handful of bits per language to signal morphological type.
