RAT-SQL: Relation-Aware Schema Encoding and Linking for Text-to-SQL Parsers | Bailin Wang | when translating natural language questions into sql queries to answer questions from a database , contemporary semantic parsing models struggle to generalize to unseen database schemas. the generalization challenge lies in \( a \) encoding the database relations in an accessible way for the semantic parser , and \( b \) modeling alignment between database columns and their mentions in a given query. we present a unified framework , based on the relation-aware self-attention mechanism , to address schema encoding , schema linking , and feature representation within a text-to-sql encoder. on the challenging spider dataset this framework boosts the exact match accuracy to 57.2% , surpassing its best counterparts by 8.7% absolute improvement. further augmented with bert , it achieves the new state-of-the-art performance of 65.6% on the spider leaderboard. in addition , we observe qualitative improvements in the modelâ€™s understanding of schema linking and alignment. our implementation will be open-sourced at https://github.com/microsoft/rat-sql.
