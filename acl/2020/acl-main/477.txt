Discourse as a Function of Event: Profiling Discourse Structure in News Articles around the Main Event | Prafulla Kumar Choubey | understanding discourse structures of news articles is vital to effectively contextualize the occurrence of a news event. to enable computational modeling of news structures , we apply an existing theory of functional discourse structure for news articles that revolves around the main event and create a human-annotated corpus of 802 documents spanning over four domains and three media sources. next , we propose several document-level neural-network models to automatically construct news content structures. finally , we demonstrate that incorporating system predicted news structures yields new state-of-the-art performance for event coreference resolution. the news documents we annotated are openly available and the annotations are publicly released for future research.
