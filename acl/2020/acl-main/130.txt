You Impress Me: Dialogue Generation via Mutual Persona Perception | Qian Liu | despite the continuing efforts to improve the engagingness and consistency of chit-chat dialogue systems , the majority of current work simply focus on mimicking human-like responses , leaving understudied the aspects of modeling understanding between interlocutors. the research in cognitive science , instead , suggests that understanding is an essential signal for a high-quality chit-chat conversation. motivated by this , we propose pˆ2 bot , a transmitter-receiver based framework with the aim of explicitly modeling understanding. specifically , pˆ2 bot incorporates mutual persona perception to enhance the quality of personalized dialogue generation. experiments on a large public dataset , persona-chat , demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach , with a considerable boost over the state-of-the-art baselines across both automatic metrics and human evaluations.
