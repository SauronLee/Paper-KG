Incorporating External Knowledge through Pre-training for Natural Language to Code Generation | Frank F. Xu | open-domain code generation aims to generate code in a general-purpose programming language \( such as python \) from natural language \( nl \) intents. motivated by the intuition that developers usually retrieve resources on the web when writing code , we explore the effectiveness of incorporating two varieties of external knowledge into nl-to-code generation: automatically mined nl-code pairs from the online programming qa forum stackoverflow and programming language api documentation. our evaluations show that combining the two sources with data augmentation and retrieval-based data re-sampling improves the current state-of-the-art by up to 2.2% absolute bleu score on the code generation testbed conala. the code and resources are available at https://github.com/neulab/external-knowledge-codegen.
