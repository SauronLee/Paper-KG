Extractive Summarization as Text Matching | Ming Zhong | this paper creates a paradigm shift with regard to the way we build neural extractive summarization systems. instead of following the commonly used framework of extracting sentences individually and modeling the relationship between sentences , we formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem , in which a source document and candidate summaries will be \( extracted from the original text \) matched in a semantic space. notably , this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is well-grounded in our comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractors based on the property of the dataset. besides , even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching model , we have driven the state-of-the-art extractive result on cnn/dailymail to a new level \( 44.41 in rouge-1 \) . experiments on the other five datasets also show the effectiveness of the matching framework. we believe the power of this matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. to encourage more instantiations in the future , we have released our codes , processed dataset , as well as generated summaries in
