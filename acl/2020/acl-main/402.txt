Analyzing Political Parody in Social Media | Antonis Maronikolakis | parody is a figurative device used to imitate an entity for comedic or critical purposes and represents a widespread phenomenon in social media through many popular parody accounts. in this paper , we present the first computational study of parody. we introduce a new publicly available data set of tweets from real politicians and their corresponding parody accounts. we run a battery of supervised machine learning models for automatically detecting parody tweets with an emphasis on robustness by testing on tweets from accounts unseen in training , across different genders and across countries. our results show that political parody tweets can be predicted with an accuracy up to 90%. finally , we identify the markers of parody through a linguistic analysis. beyond research in linguistics and political communication , accurately and automatically detecting parody is important to improving fact checking for journalists and analytics such as sentiment analysis through filtering out parodical utterances.
