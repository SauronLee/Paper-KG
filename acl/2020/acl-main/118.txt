AMR Parsing via Graph-Sequence Iterative Inference | Deng Cai | we propose a new end-to-end model that treats amr parsing as a series of dual decisions on the input sequence and the incrementally constructed graph. at each time step , our model performs multiple rounds of attention , reasoning , and composition that aim to answer two critical questions: \( 1 \) which part of the input
