IMoJIE: Iterative Memory-Based Joint Open Information Extraction | Keshav Kolluru | while traditional systems for open information extraction were statistical and rule-based , recently neural models have been introduced for the task. our work builds upon copyattention , a sequence generation openie model \( cui et. al. 18 \) . our analysis reveals that copyattention produces a constant number of extractions per sentence , and its extracted tuples often express redundant information. we present imojie , an extension to copyattention , which produces the next extraction conditioned on all previously extracted tuples. this approach overcomes both shortcomings of copyattention , resulting in a variable number of diverse extractions per sentence. we train imojie on training data bootstrapped from extractions of several non-neural systems , which have been automatically filtered to reduce redundancy and noise. imojie outperforms copyattention by about 18 f1 pts , and a bert-based strong baseline by 2 f1 pts , establishing a new state of the art for the task.
