Exact yet Efficient Graph Parsing, Bi-directional Locality and the Constructivist Hypothesis | Yajie Ye | a key problem in processing graph-based meaning representations is graph parsing , i.e. computing all possible derivations of a given graph according to a \( competence \) grammar. we demonstrate , for the first time , that exact graph parsing can be efficient for large graphs and with large hyperedge replacement grammars \( hrgs \) . the advance is achieved by exploiting locality as terminal edge-adjacency in hrg rules. in particular , we highlight the importance of 1 \) a terminal edge-first parsing strategy , 2 \) a categorization of a subclass of hrg , i.e. what we call weakly regular graph grammar , and 3 \) distributing argument-structures to both lexical and phrasal rules.
