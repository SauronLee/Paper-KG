Reasoning with Latent Structure Refinement for Document-Level Relation Extraction | Guoshun Nan | document-level relation extraction requires integrating information within and across multiple sentences of a document and capturing complex interactions between inter-sentence entities. however , effective aggregation of relevant information in the document remains a challenging research question. existing approaches construct static document-level graphs based on syntactic trees , co-references or heuristics from the unstructured text to model the dependencies. unlike previous methods that may not be able to capture rich non-local interactions for inference , we propose a novel model that empowers the relational reasoning across sentences by automatically inducing the latent document-level graph. we further develop a refinement strategy , which enables the model to incrementally aggregate relevant information for multi-hop reasoning. specifically , our model achieves an f1 score of 59.05 on a large-scale document-level dataset \( docred \) , significantly improving over the previous results , and also yields new state-of-the-art results on the cdr and gda dataset. furthermore , extensive analyses show that the model is able to discover more accurate inter-sentence relations.
