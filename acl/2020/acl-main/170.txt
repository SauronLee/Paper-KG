Improving Non-autoregressive Neural Machine Translation with Monolingual Data | Jiawei Zhou | non-autoregressive \( nar \) neural machine translation is usually done via knowledge distillation from an autoregressive \( ar \) model. under this framework , we leverage large monolingual corpora to improve the nar model’s performance , with the goal of transferring the ar model’s generalization ability while preventing overfitting. on top of a strong nar baseline , our experimental results on the wmt14 en-de and wmt16 en-ro news translation tasks confirm that monolingual data augmentation consistently improves the performance of the nar model to approach the teacher ar model’s performance , yields comparable or better results than the best non-iterative nar methods in the literature and helps reduce overfitting in the training process.
