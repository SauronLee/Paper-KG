Classification-Based Self-Learning for Weakly Supervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction | Mladen Karan | effective projection-based cross-lingual word embedding \( clwe \) induction critically relies on the iterative self-learning procedure. it gradually expands the initial small seed dictionary to learn improved cross-lingual mappings. in this work , we present classymap , a classification-based approach to self-learning , yielding a more robust and a more effective induction of projection-based clwes. unlike prior self-learning methods , our approach allows for integration of diverse features into the iterative process. we show the benefits of classymap for bilingual lexicon induction: we report consistent improvements in a weakly supervised setup \( 500 seed translation pairs \) on a benchmark with 28 language pairs.
