A Methodology for Creating Question Answering Corpora Using Inverse Data Annotation | Jan Deriu | in this paper , we introduce a novel methodology to efficiently construct a corpus for question answering over structured data. for this , we introduce an intermediate representation that is based on the logical query plan in a database , called operation trees \( ot \) . this representation allows us to invert the annotation process without loosing flexibility in the types of queries that we generate. furthermore , it allows for fine-grained alignment of the tokens to the operations. thus , we randomly generate ots from a context free grammar and annotators just have to write the appropriate question and assign the tokens. we compare our corpus otta \( operation trees and token assignment \) , a large semantic parsing corpus for evaluating natural language interfaces to databases , to spider and lc-quad 2.0 and show that our methodology more than triples the annotation speed while maintaining the complexity of the queries. finally , we train a state-of-the-art semantic parsing model on our data and show that our dataset is a challenging dataset and that the token alignment can be leveraged to significantly increase the performance.
