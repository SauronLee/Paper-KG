Harvesting and Refining Question-Answer Pairs for Unsupervised QA | Zhongli Li | question answering \( qa \) has shown great success thanks to the availability of large-scale datasets and the effectiveness of neural models. recent research works have attempted to extend these successes to the settings with few or no labeled data available. in this work , we introduce two approaches to improve unsupervised qa. first , we harvest lexically and syntactically divergent questions from wikipedia to automatically construct a corpus of question-answer pairs \( named as refqa \) . second , we take advantage of the qa model to extract more appropriate answers , which iteratively refines data over refqa. we conduct experiments on squad 1.1 , and newsqa by fine-tuning bert without access to manually annotated data. our approach outperforms previous unsupervised approaches by a large margin , and is competitive with early supervised models. we also show the effectiveness of our approach in the few-shot learning setting.
