Reasoning with Multimodal Sarcastic Tweets via Modeling Cross-Modality Contrast and Semantic Association | Nan Xu | sarcasm is a sophisticated linguistic phenomenon to express the opposite of what one really means. with the rapid growth of social media , multimodal sarcastic tweets are widely posted on various social platforms. in multimodal context , sarcasm is no longer a pure linguistic phenomenon , and due to the nature of social media short text , the opposite is more often manifested via cross-modality expressions. thus traditional text-based methods are insufficient to detect multimodal sarcasm. to reason with multimodal sarcastic tweets , in this paper , we propose a novel method for modeling cross-modality contrast in the associated context. our method models both cross-modality contrast and semantic association by constructing the decomposition and relation network \( namely d&r net \) . the decomposition network represents the commonality and discrepancy between image and text , and the relation network models the semantic association in cross-modality context. experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in multimodal sarcasm detection.
