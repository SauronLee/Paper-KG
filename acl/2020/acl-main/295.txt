SpanMlt: A Span-based Multi-Task Learning Framework for Pair-wise Aspect and Opinion Terms Extraction | He Zhao | aspect terms extraction and opinion terms extraction are two key problems of fine-grained aspect based sentiment analysis \( absa \) . the aspect-opinion pairs can provide a global profile about a product or service for consumers and opinion mining systems. however , traditional methods can not directly output aspect-opinion pairs without given aspect terms or opinion terms. although some recent co-extraction methods have been proposed to extract both terms jointly , they fail to extract them as pairs. to this end , this paper proposes an end-to-end method to solve the task of pair-wise aspect and opinion terms extraction \( paote \) . furthermore , this paper treats the problem from a perspective of joint term and relation extraction rather than under the sequence tagging formulation performed in most prior works. we propose a multi-task learning framework based on shared spans , where the terms are extracted under the supervision of span boundaries. meanwhile , the pair-wise relations are jointly identified using the span representations. extensive experiments show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
