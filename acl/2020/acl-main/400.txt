Sentiment and Emotion help Sarcasm? A Multi-task Learning Framework for Multi-Modal Sarcasm, Sentiment and Emotion Analysis | Dushyant Singh Chauhan | in this paper , we hypothesize that sarcasm is closely related to sentiment and emotion , and thereby propose a multi-task deep learning framework to solve all these three problems simultaneously in a multi-modal conversational scenario. we , at first , manually annotate the recently released multi-modal mustard sarcasm dataset with sentiment and emotion classes , both implicit and explicit. for multi-tasking , we propose two attention mechanisms , viz. inter-segment inter-modal attention \( ie-attention \) and intra-segment inter-modal attention \( ia-attention \) . the main motivation of ie-attention is to learn the relationship between the different segments of the sentence across the modalities. in contrast , ia-attention focuses within the same segment of the sentence across the modalities. finally , representations from both the attentions are concatenated and shared across the five classes \( i.e. , sarcasm , implicit sentiment , explicit sentiment , implicit emotion , explicit emotion \) for multi-tasking. experimental results on the extended version of the mustard dataset show the efficacy of our proposed approach for sarcasm detection over the existing state-of-the-art systems. the evaluation also shows that the proposed multi-task framework yields better performance for the primary task , i.e. , sarcasm detection , with the help of two secondary tasks , emotion and sentiment analysis.
