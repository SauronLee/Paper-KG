Verbal Multiword Expressions for Identification of Metaphor | Omid Rohanian | metaphor is a linguistic device in which a concept is expressed by mentioning another. identifying metaphorical expressions , therefore , requires a non-compositional understanding of semantics. multiword expressions \( mwes \) , on the other hand , are linguistic phenomena with varying degrees of semantic opacity and their identification poses a challenge to computational models. this work is the first attempt at analysing the interplay of metaphor and mwes processing through the design of a neural architecture whereby classification of metaphors is enhanced by informing the model of the presence of mwes. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first “mwe-aware” metaphor identification system paving the way for further experiments on the complex interactions of these phenomena. the results and analyses show that this proposed architecture reach state-of-the-art on two different established metaphor datasets.
