Soft Gazetteers for Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition | Shruti Rijhwani | traditional named entity recognition models use gazetteers \( lists of entities \) as features to improve performance. although modern neural network models do not require such hand-crafted features for strong performance , recent work has demonstrated their utility for named entity recognition on english data. however , designing such features for low-resource languages is challenging , because exhaustive entity gazetteers do not exist in these languages. to address this problem , we propose a method of “soft gazetteers” that incorporates ubiquitously available information from english knowledge bases , such as wikipedia , into neural named entity recognition models through cross-lingual entity linking. our experiments on four low-resource languages show an average improvement of 4 points in f1 score.
