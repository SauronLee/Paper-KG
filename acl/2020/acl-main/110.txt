KLEJ: Comprehensive Benchmark for Polish Language Understanding | Piotr Rybak | in recent years , a series of transformer-based models unlocked major improvements in general natural language understanding \( nlu \) tasks. such a fast pace of research would not be possible without general nlu benchmarks , which allow for a fair comparison of the proposed methods. however , such benchmarks are available only for a handful of languages. to alleviate this issue , we introduce a comprehensive multi-task benchmark for the polish language understanding , accompanied by an online leaderboard. it consists of a diverse set of tasks , adopted from existing datasets for named entity recognition , question-answering , textual entailment , and others. we also introduce a new sentiment analysis task for the e-commerce domain , named allegro reviews \( ar \) . to ensure a common evaluation scheme and promote models that generalize to different nlu tasks , the benchmark includes datasets from varying domains and applications. additionally , we release herbert , a transformer-based model trained specifically for the polish language , which has the best average performance and obtains the best results for three out of nine tasks. finally , we provide an extensive evaluation , including several standard baselines and recently proposed , multilingual transformer-based models.
