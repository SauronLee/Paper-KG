Explicit Memory Tracker with Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Conversational Machine Reading | Yifan Gao | the goal of conversational machine reading is to answer user questions given a knowledge base text which may require asking clarification questions. existing approaches are limited in their decision making due to struggles in extracting question-related rules and reasoning about them. in this paper , we present a new framework of conversational machine reading that comprises a novel explicit memory tracker \( emt \) to track whether conditions listed in the rule text have already been satisfied to make a decision. moreover , our framework generates clarification questions by adopting a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy , utilizing sentence-level entailment scores to weight token-level distributions. on the sharc benchmark \( blind , held-out \) testset , emt achieves new state-of-the-art results of 74.6% micro-averaged decision accuracy and 49.5 bleu4. we also show that emt is more interpretable by visualizing the entailment-oriented reasoning process as the conversation flows. code and models are released at https://github.com/yifan-gao/explicit_memory_tracker.
