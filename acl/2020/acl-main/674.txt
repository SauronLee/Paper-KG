Non-Linear Instance-Based Cross-Lingual Mapping for Non-Isomorphic Embedding Spaces | Goran Glavaš | we present instamap , an instance-based method for learning projection-based cross-lingual word embeddings. unlike prior work , it deviates from learning a single global linear projection. instamap is a non-parametric model that learns a non-linear projection by iteratively: \( 1 \) finding a globally optimal rotation of the source embedding space relying on the kabsch algorithm , and then \( 2 \) moving each point along an instance-specific translation vector estimated from the translation vectors of the point’s nearest neighbours in the training dictionary. we report performance gains with instamap over four representative state-of-the-art projection-based models on bilingual lexicon induction across a set of 28 diverse language pairs. we note prominent improvements , especially for more distant language pairs \( i.e. , languages with non-isomorphic monolingual spaces \) .
