ESPRIT: Explaining Solutions to Physical Reasoning Tasks | Nazneen Fatema Rajani | neural networks lack the ability to reason about qualitative physics and so cannot generalize to scenarios and tasks unseen during training. we propose esprit , a framework for commonsense reasoning about qualitative physics in natural language that generates interpretable descriptions of physical events. we use a two-step approach of first identifying the pivotal physical events in an environment and then generating natural language descriptions of those events using a data-to-text approach. our framework learns to generate explanations of how the physical simulation will causally evolve so that an agent or a human can easily reason about a solution using those interpretable descriptions. human evaluations indicate that esprit produces crucial fine-grained details and has high coverage of physical concepts compared to even human annotations. dataset , code and documentation are available at
