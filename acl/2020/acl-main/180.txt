What determines the order of adjectives in English? Comparing efficiency-based theories using dependency treebanks | Richard Futrell | we take up the scientific question of what determines the preferred order of adjectives in english , in phrases such as big blue box where multiple adjectives modify a following noun. we implement and test four quantitative theories , all of which are theoretically motivated in terms of efficiency in human language production and comprehension. the four theories we test are subjectivity \( scontras et al. , 2017 \) , information locality \( futrell , 2019 \) , integration cost \( dyer , 2017 \) , and information gain , which we introduce. we evaluate theories based on their ability to predict orders of unseen adjectives in hand-parsed and automatically-parsed dependency treebanks. we find that subjectivity , information locality , and information gain are all strong predictors , with some evidence for a two-factor account , where subjectivity and information gain reflect a factor involving semantics , and information locality reflects collocational preferences.
