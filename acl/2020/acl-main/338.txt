Donâ€™t Eclipse Your Arts Due to Small Discrepancies: Boundary Repositioning with a Pointer Network for Aspect Extraction | Zhenkai Wei | the current aspect extraction methods suffer from boundary errors. in general , these errors lead to a relatively minor difference between the extracted aspects and the ground-truth. however , they hurt the performance severely. in this paper , we propose to utilize a pointer network for repositioning the boundaries. recycling mechanism is used , which enables the training data to be collected without manual intervention. we conduct the experiments on the benchmark datasets se14 of laptop and se14-16 of restaurant. experimental results show that our method achieves substantial improvements over the baseline , and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
