Simple and Effective Retrieve-Edit-Rerank Text Generation | Nabil Hossain | retrieve-and-edit seq2seq methods typically retrieve an output from the training set and learn a model to edit it to produce the final output. we propose to extend this framework with a simple and effective post-generation ranking approach. our framework \( i \) retrieves several potentially relevant outputs for each input , \( ii \) edits each candidate independently , and \( iii \) re-ranks the edited candidates to select the final output. we use a standard editing model with simple task-specific re-ranking approaches , and we show empirically that this approach outperforms existing , significantly more complex methodologies. experiments on two machine translation \( mt \) datasets show new state-of-art results. we also achieve near state-of-art performance on the gigaword summarization dataset , where our analyses show that there is significant room for performance improvement with better candidate output selection in future work.
