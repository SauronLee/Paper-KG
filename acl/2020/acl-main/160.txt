Modelling Suspense in Short Stories as Uncertainty Reduction over Neural Representation | David Wilmot | suspense is a crucial ingredient of narrative fiction , engaging readers and making stories compelling. while there is a vast theoretical literature on suspense , it is computationally not well understood. we compare two ways for modelling suspense: surprise , a backward-looking measure of how unexpected the current state is given the story so far; and uncertainty reduction , a forward-looking measure of how unexpected the continuation of the story is. both can be computed either directly over story representations or over their probability distributions. we propose a hierarchical language model that encodes stories and computes surprise and uncertainty reduction. evaluating against short stories annotated with human suspense judgements , we find that uncertainty reduction over representations is the best predictor , resulting in near human accuracy. we also show that uncertainty reduction can be used to predict suspenseful events in movie synopses.
