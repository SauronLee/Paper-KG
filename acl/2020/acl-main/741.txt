Exploring Unexplored Generalization Challenges for Cross-Database Semantic Parsing | Alane Suhr | we study the task of cross-database semantic parsing \( xsp \) , where a system that maps natural language utterances to executable sql queries is evaluated on databases unseen during training. recently , several datasets , including spider , were proposed to support development of xsp systems. we propose a challenging evaluation setup for cross-database semantic parsing , focusing on variation across database schemas and in-domain language use. we re-purpose eight semantic parsing datasets that have been well-studied in the setting where in-domain training data is available , and instead use them as additional evaluation data for xsp systems instead. we build a system that performs well on spider , and find that it struggles to generalize to our re-purposed set. our setup uncovers several generalization challenges for cross-database semantic parsing , demonstrating the need to use and develop diverse training and evaluation datasets.
