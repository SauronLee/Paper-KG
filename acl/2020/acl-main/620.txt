Closing the Gap: Joint De-Identification and Concept Extraction in the Clinical Domain | Lukas Lange | exploiting natural language processing in the clinical domain requires de-identification , i.e. , anonymization of personal information in texts. however , current research considers de-identification and downstream tasks , such as concept extraction , only in isolation and does not study the effects of de-identification on other tasks. in this paper , we close this gap by reporting concept extraction performance on automatically anonymized data and investigating joint models for de-identification and concept extraction. in particular , we propose a stacked model with restricted access to privacy sensitive information and a multitask model. we set the new state of the art on benchmark datasets in english \( 96.1% f1 for de-identification and 88.9% f1 for concept extraction \) and spanish \( 91.4% f1 for concept extraction \) .
