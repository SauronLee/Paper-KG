It’s Morphin’ Time! Combating Linguistic Discrimination with Inflectional Perturbations | Samson Tan | training on only perfect standard english corpora predisposes pre-trained neural networks to discriminate against minorities from non-standard linguistic backgrounds \( e.g. , african american vernacular english , colloquial singapore english , etc. \) . we perturb the inflectional morphology of words to craft plausible and semantically similar adversarial examples that expose these biases in popular nlp models , e.g. , bert and transformer , and show that adversarially fine-tuning them for a single epoch significantly improves robustness without sacrificing performance on clean data.
