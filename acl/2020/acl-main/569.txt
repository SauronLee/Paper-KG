Amalgamation of protein sequence, structure and textual information for improving protein-protein interaction identification | Pratik Dutta | an in-depth exploration of protein-protein interactions \( ppi \) is essential to understand the metabolism in addition to the regulations of biological entities like proteins , carbohydrates , and many more. most of the recent ppi tasks in bionlp domain have been carried out solely using textual data. in this paper , we argue that incorporating multimodal cues can improve the automatic identification of ppi. as a first step towards enabling the development of multimodal approaches for ppi identification , we have developed two multi-modal datasets which are extensions and multi-modal versions of two popular benchmark ppi corpora \( bioinfer and hrpd50 \) . besides , existing textual modalities , two new modalities , 3d protein structure and underlying genomic sequence , are also added to each instance. further , a novel deep multi-modal architecture is also implemented to efficiently predict the protein interactions from the developed datasets. a detailed experimental analysis reveals the superiority of the multi-modal approach in comparison to the strong baselines including unimodal approaches and state-of the-art methods over both the generated multi-modal datasets. the developed multi-modal datasets are available for use at https://github.com/sduttap16/mm_ppi_nlp.
