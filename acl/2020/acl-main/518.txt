A Unified MRC Framework for Named Entity Recognition | Xiaoya Li | the task of named entity recognition \( ner \) is normally divided into nested ner and flat ner depending on whether named entities are nested or not.models are usually separately developed for the two tasks , since sequence labeling models , the most widely used backbone for flat ner , are only able to assign a single label to a particular token , which is unsuitable for nested ner where a token may be assigned several labels. in this paper , we propose a unified framework that is capable of handling both flat and nested ner tasks. instead of treating the task of ner as a sequence labeling problem , we propose to formulate it as a machine reading comprehension \( mrc \) task. for example , extracting entities with the per label is formalized as extracting answer spans to the question â€œ
