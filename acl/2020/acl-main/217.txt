Grounding Conversations with Improvised Dialogues | Hyundong Cho | effective dialogue involves grounding , the process of establishing mutual knowledge that is essential for communication between people. modern dialogue systems are not explicitly trained to build common ground , and therefore overlook this important aspect of communication. improvisational theater \( improv \) intrinsically contains a high proportion of dialogue focused on building common ground , and makes use of the yes-and principle , a strong grounding speech act , to establish coherence and an actionable objective reality. we collect a corpus of more than 26 , 000 yes-and turns , transcribing them from improv dialogues and extracting them from larger , but more sparsely populated movie script dialogue corpora , via a bootstrapped classifier. we fine-tune chit-chat dialogue systems with our corpus to encourage more grounded , relevant conversation and confirm these findings with human evaluations.
