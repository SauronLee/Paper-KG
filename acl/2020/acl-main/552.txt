Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Extractive Document Summarization | Danqing Wang | as a crucial step in extractive document summarization , learning cross-sentence relations has been explored by a plethora of approaches. an intuitive way is to put them in the graph-based neural network , which has a more complex structure for capturing inter-sentence relationships. in this paper , we present a heterogeneous graph-based neural network for extractive summarization \( hetersumgraph \) , which contains semantic nodes of different granularity levels apart from sentences. these additional nodes act as the intermediary between sentences and enrich the cross-sentence relations. besides , our graph structure is flexible in natural extension from a single-document setting to multi-document via introducing document nodes. to our knowledge , we are the first one to introduce different types of nodes into graph-based neural networks for extractive document summarization and perform a comprehensive qualitative analysis to investigate their benefits. the code will be released on github.
