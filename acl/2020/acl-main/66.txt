Line Graph Enhanced AMR-to-Text Generation with Mix-Order Graph Attention Networks | Yanbin Zhao | efficient structure encoding for graphs with labeled edges is an important yet challenging point in many graph-based models. this work focuses on amr-to-text generation â€“ a graph-to-sequence task aiming to recover natural language from abstract meaning representations \( amr \) . existing graph-to-sequence approaches generally utilize graph neural networks as their encoders , which have two limitations: 1 \) the message propagation process in amr graphs is only guided by the first-order adjacency information. 2 \) the relationships between labeled edges are not fully considered. in this work , we propose a novel graph encoding framework which can effectively explore the edge relations. we also adopt graph attention networks with higher-order neighborhood information to encode the rich structure in amr graphs. experiment results show that our approach obtains new state-of-the-art performance on english amr benchmark datasets. the ablation analyses also demonstrate that both edge relations and higher-order information are beneficial to graph-to-sequence modeling.
