Dynamic Fusion Network for Multi-Domain End-to-end Task-Oriented Dialog | Libo Qin | recent studies have shown remarkable success in end-to-end task-oriented dialog system. however , most neural models rely on large training data , which are only available for a certain number of task domains , such as navigation and scheduling. this makes it difficult to scalable for a new domain with limited labeled data. however , there has been relatively little research on how to effectively use data from all domains to improve the performance of each domain and also unseen domains. to this end , we investigate methods that can make explicit use of domain knowledge and introduce a shared-private network to learn shared and specific knowledge. in addition , we propose a novel dynamic fusion network \( df-net \) which automatically exploit the relevance between the target domain and each domain. results show that our models outperforms existing methods on multi-domain dialogue , giving the state-of-the-art in the literature. besides , with little training data , we show its transferability by outperforming prior best model by 13.9% on average.
