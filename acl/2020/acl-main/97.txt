Towards Conversational Recommendation over Multi-Type Dialogs | Zeming Liu | we focus on the study of conversational recommendation in the context of multi-type dialogs , where the bots can proactively and naturally lead a conversation from a non-recommendation dialog \( e.g. , qa \) to a recommendation dialog , taking into account userâ€™s interests and feedback. to facilitate the study of this task , we create a human-to-human chinese dialog dataset durecdial \( about 10k dialogs , 156k utterances \) , where there are multiple sequential dialogs for a pair of a recommendation seeker \( user \) and a recommender \( bot \) . in each dialog , the recommender proactively leads a multi-type dialog to approach recommendation targets and then makes multiple recommendations with rich interaction behavior. this dataset allows us to systematically investigate different parts of the overall problem , e.g. , how to naturally lead a dialog , how to interact with users for recommendation. finally we establish baseline results on durecdial for future studies.
