Towards Better Non-Tree Argument Mining: Proposition-Level Biaffine Parsing with Task-Specific Parameterization | Gaku Morio | state-of-the-art argument mining studies have advanced the techniques for predicting argument structures. however , the technology for capturing non-tree-structured arguments is still in its infancy. in this paper , we focus on non-tree argument mining with a neural model. we jointly predict proposition types and edges between propositions. our proposed model incorporates \( i \) task-specific parameterization \( tsp \) that effectively encodes a sequence of propositions and \( ii \) a proposition-level biaffine attention \( plba \) that can predict a non-tree argument consisting of edges. experimental results show that both tsp and plba boost edge prediction performance compared to baselines.
