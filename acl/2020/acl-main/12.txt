A Complete Shift-Reduce Chinese Discourse Parser with Robust Dynamic Oracle | Shyh-Shiun Hung | this work proposes a standalone , complete chinese discourse parser for practical applications. we approach chinese discourse parsing from a variety of aspects and improve the shift-reduce parser not only by integrating the pre-trained text encoder , but also by employing novel training strategies. we revise the dynamic-oracle procedure for training the shift-reduce parser , and apply unsupervised data augmentation to enhance rhetorical relation recognition. experimental results show that our chinese discourse parser achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
