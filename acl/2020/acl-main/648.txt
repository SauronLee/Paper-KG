Predicting the Growth of Morphological Families from Social and Linguistic Factors | Valentin Hofmann | we present the first study that examines the evolution of morphological families , i.e. , sets of morphologically related words such as “trump” , “antitrumpism” , and “detrumpify” , in social media. we introduce the novel task of morphological family expansion prediction \( mfep \) as predicting the increase in the size of a morphological family. we create a ten-year reddit corpus as a benchmark for mfep and evaluate a number of baselines on this benchmark. our experiments demonstrate very good performance on mfep.
