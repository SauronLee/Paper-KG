Distinguish Confusing Law Articles for Legal Judgment Prediction | Nuo Xu | legal judgement prediction \( ljp \) is the task of automatically predicting a law case’s judgment results given a text describing the case’s facts , which has great prospects in judicial assistance systems and handy services for the public. in practice , confusing charges are often presented , because law cases applicable to similar law articles are easily misjudged. to address this issue , existing work relies heavily on domain experts , which hinders its application in different law systems. in this paper , we present an end-to-end model , ladan , to solve the task of ljp. to distinguish confusing charges , we propose a novel graph neural network , gdl , to automatically learn subtle differences between confusing law articles , and also design a novel attention mechanism that fully exploits the learned differences to attentively extract effective discriminative features from fact descriptions. experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our ladan.
