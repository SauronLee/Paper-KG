Emergence of Syntax Needs Minimal Supervision | Raphaël Bailly | this paper is a theoretical contribution to the debate on the learnability of syntax from a corpus without explicit syntax-specific guidance. our approach originates in the observable structure of a corpus , which we use to define and isolate grammaticality \( syntactic information \) and meaning/pragmatics information. we describe the formal characteristics of an autonomous syntax and show that it becomes possible to search for syntax-based lexical categories with a simple optimization process , without any prior hypothesis on the form of the model.
