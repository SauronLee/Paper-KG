Syn-QG: Syntactic and Shallow Semantic Rules for Question Generation | Kaustubh Dhole | question generation \( qg \) is fundamentally a simple syntactic transformation; however , many aspects of semantics influence what questions are good to form. we implement this observation by developing syn-qg , a set of transparent syntactic rules leveraging universal dependencies , shallow semantic parsing , lexical resources , and custom rules which transform declarative sentences into question-answer pairs. we utilize propbank argument descriptions and verbnet state predicates to incorporate shallow semantic content , which helps generate questions of a descriptive nature and produce inferential and semantically richer questions than existing systems. in order to improve syntactic fluency and eliminate grammatically incorrect questions , we employ back-translation over the output of these syntactic rules. a set of crowd-sourced evaluations shows that our system can generate a larger number of highly grammatical and relevant questions than previous qg systems and that back-translation drastically improves grammaticality at a slight cost of generating irrelevant questions.
