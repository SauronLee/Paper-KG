Learning Robust Models for e-Commerce Product Search | Thanh Nguyen | showing items that do not match search query intent degrades customer experience in e-commerce. these mismatches result from counterfactual biases of the ranking algorithms toward noisy behavioral signals such as clicks and purchases in the search logs. mitigating the problem requires a large labeled dataset , which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. in this paper , we develop a deep , end-to-end model that learns to effectively classify mismatches and to generate hard mismatched examples to improve the classifier. we train the model end-to-end by introducing a latent variable into the cross-entropy loss that alternates between using the real and generated samples. this not only makes the classifier more robust but also boosts the overall ranking performance. our model achieves a relative gain compared to baselines by over 26% in f-score , and over 17% in area under pr curve. on live search traffic , our model gains significant improvement in multiple countries.
