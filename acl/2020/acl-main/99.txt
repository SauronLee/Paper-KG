Expertise Style Transfer: A New Task Towards Better Communication between Experts and Laymen | Yixin Cao | the curse of knowledge can impede communication between experts and laymen. we propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases. solving this task not only simplifies the professional language , but also improves the accuracy and expertise level of laymen descriptions using simple words. this is a challenging task , unaddressed in previous work , as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. we establish the benchmark performance of five state-of-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. the results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance. we also discuss the challenges of automatic evaluation , to provide insights into future research directions. the dataset is publicly available at https://srhthu.github.io/expertise-style-transfer/.
