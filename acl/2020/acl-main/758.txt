Automated Topical Component Extraction Using Neural Network Attention Scores from Source-based Essay Scoring | Haoran Zhang | while automated essay scoring \( aes \) can reliably grade essays at scale , automated writing evaluation \( awe \) additionally provides formative feedback to guide essay revision. however , a neural aes typically does not provide useful feature representations for supporting awe. this paper presents a method for linking awe and neural aes , by extracting topical components \( tcs \) representing evidence from a source text using the intermediate output of attention layers. we evaluate performance using a feature-based aes requiring tcs. results show that performance is comparable whether using automatically or manually constructed tcs for 1 \) representing essays as rubric-based features , 2 \) grading essays.
