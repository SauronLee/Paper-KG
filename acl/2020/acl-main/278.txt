Camouflaged Chinese Spam Content Detection with Semi-supervised Generative Active Learning | Zhuoren Jiang | we propose a semi-supervised generative active learning \( signal \) model to address the imbalance , efficiency , and text camouflage problems of chinese text spam detection task. a “self-diversity” criterion is proposed for measuring the “worthiness” of a candidate for annotation. a semi-supervised variational autoencoder with masked attention learning approach and a character variation graph-enhanced augmentation procedure are proposed for data augmentation. the preliminary experiment demonstrates the proposed signal model is not only sensitive to spam sample selection , but also can improve the performance of a series of conventional active learning models for chinese spam detection task. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to integrate active learning and semi-supervised generative learning for text spam detection.
