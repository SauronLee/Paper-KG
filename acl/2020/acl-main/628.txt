Transition-based Semantic Dependency Parsing with Pointer Networks | Daniel Fernández-González | transition-based parsers implemented with pointer networks have become the new state of the art in dependency parsing , excelling in producing labelled syntactic trees and outperforming graph-based models in this task. in order to further test the capabilities of these powerful neural networks on a harder nlp problem , we propose a transition system that , thanks to pointer networks , can straightforwardly produce labelled directed acyclic graphs and perform semantic dependency parsing. in addition , we enhance our approach with deep contextualized word embeddings extracted from bert. the resulting system not only outperforms all existing transition-based models , but also matches the best fully-supervised accuracy to date on the semeval 2015 task 18 datasets among previous state-of-the-art graph-based parsers.
