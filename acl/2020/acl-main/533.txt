Neural-DINF: A Neural Network based Framework for Measuring Document Influence | Jie Tan | measuring the scholarly impact of a document without citations is an important and challenging problem. existing approaches such as document influence model \( dim \) are based on dynamic topic models , which only consider the word frequency change. in this paper , we use both frequency changes and word semantic shifts to measure document influence by developing a neural network framework. our model has three steps. firstly , we train the word embeddings for different time periods. subsequently , we propose an unsupervised method to align vectors for different time periods. finally , we compute the influence value of documents. our experimental results show that our model outperforms dim.
