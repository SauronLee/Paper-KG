Predictive Biases in Natural Language Processing Models: A Conceptual Framework and Overview | Deven Santosh Shah | an increasing number of natural language processing papers address the effect of bias on predictions , introducing mitigation techniques at different parts of the standard nlp pipeline \( data and models \) . however , these works have been conducted individually , without a unifying framework to organize efforts within the field. this situation leads to repetitive approaches , and focuses overly on bias symptoms/effects , rather than on their origins , which could limit the development of effective countermeasures. in this paper , we propose a unifying predictive bias framework for nlp. we summarize the nlp literature and suggest general mathematical definitions of predictive bias. we differentiate two consequences of bias: outcome disparities and error disparities , as well as four potential origins of biases: label bias , selection bias , model overamplification , and semantic bias. our framework serves as an overview of predictive bias in nlp , integrating existing work into a single structure , and providing a conceptual baseline for improved frameworks.
