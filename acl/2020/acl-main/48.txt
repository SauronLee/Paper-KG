Integrating Semantic and Structural Information with Graph Convolutional Network for Controversy Detection | Lei Zhong | identifying controversial posts on social media is a fundamental task for mining public sentiment , assessing the influence of events , and alleviating the polarized views. however , existing methods fail to 1 \) effectively incorporate the semantic information from content-related posts; 2 \) preserve the structural information for reply relationship modeling; 3 \) properly handle posts from topics dissimilar to those in the training set. to overcome the first two limitations , we propose topic-post-comment graph convolutional network \( tpc-gcn \) , which integrates the information from the graph structure and content of topics , posts , and comments for post-level controversy detection. as to the third limitation , we extend our model to disentangled tpc-gcn \( dtpc-gcn \) , to disentangle topic-related and topic-unrelated features and then fuse dynamically. extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our models outperform existing methods. analysis of the results and cases proves that our models can integrate both semantic and structural information with significant generalizability.
