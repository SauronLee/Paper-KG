Interpretable Operational Risk Classification with Semi-Supervised Variational Autoencoder | Fan Zhou | operational risk management is one of the biggest challenges nowadays faced by financial institutions. there are several major challenges of building a text classification system for automatic operational risk prediction , including imbalanced labeled/unlabeled data and lacking interpretability. to tackle these challenges , we present a semi-supervised text classification framework that integrates multi-head attention mechanism with semi-supervised variational inference for operational risk classification \( semiorc \) . we empirically evaluate the framework on a real-world dataset. the results demonstrate that our method can better utilize unlabeled data and learn visually interpretable document representations. semiorc also outperforms other baseline methods on operational risk classification.
