Recollection versus Imagination: Exploring Human Memory and Cognition via Neural Language Models | Maarten Sap | we investigate the use of nlp as a measure of the cognitive processes involved in storytelling , contrasting imagination and recollection of events. to facilitate this , we collect and release hippocorpus , a dataset of 7 , 000 stories about imagined and recalled events. we introduce a measure of narrative flow and use this to examine the narratives for imagined and recalled events. additionally , we measure the differential recruitment of knowledge attributed to semantic memory versus episodic memory \( tulving , 1972 \) for imagined and recalled storytelling by comparing the frequency of descriptions of general commonsense events with more specific realis events. our analyses show that imagined stories have a substantially more linear narrative flow , compared to recalled stories in which adjacent sentences are more disconnected. in addition , while recalled stories rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory , imagined stories express more commonsense knowledge based on semantic memory. finally , our measures reveal the effect of narrativization of memories in stories \( e.g. , stories about frequently recalled memories flow more linearly; bartlett , 1932 \) . our findings highlight the potential of using nlp tools to study the traces of human cognition in language.
