Predicting the Topical Stance and Political Leaning of Media using Tweets | Peter Stefanov | discovering the stances of media outlets and influential people on current , debatable topics is important for social statisticians and policy makers. many supervised solutions exist for determining viewpoints , but manually annotating training data is costly. in this paper , we propose a cascaded method that uses unsupervised learning to ascertain the stance of twitter users with respect to a polarizing topic by leveraging their retweet behavior; then , it uses supervised learning based on user labels to characterize both the general political leaning of online media and of popular twitter users , as well as their stance with respect to the target polarizing topic. we evaluate the model by comparing its predictions to gold labels from the media bias/fact check website , achieving 82.6% accuracy.
