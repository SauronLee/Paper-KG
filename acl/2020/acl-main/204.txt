Efficient Strategies for Hierarchical Text Classification: External Knowledge and Auxiliary Tasks | Kervy Rivas Rojas | in hierarchical text classification , we perform a sequence of inference steps to predict the category of a document from top to bottom of a given class taxonomy. most of the studies have focused on developing novels neural network architectures to deal with the hierarchical structure , but we prefer to look for efficient ways to strengthen a baseline model. we first define the task as a sequence-to-sequence problem. afterwards , we propose an auxiliary synthetic task of bottom-up-classification. then , from external dictionaries , we retrieve textual definitions for the classes of all the hierarchyâ€™s layers , and map them into the word vector space. we use the class-definition embeddings as an additional input to condition the prediction of the next layer and in an adapted beam search. whereas the modified search did not provide large gains , the combination of the auxiliary task and the additional input of class-definitions significantly enhance the classification accuracy. with our efficient approaches , we outperform previous studies , using a drastically reduced number of parameters , in two well-known english datasets.
