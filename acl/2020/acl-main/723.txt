CluHTM - Semantic Hierarchical Topic Modeling based on CluWords | Felipe Viegas | hierarchical topic modeling \( htm \) exploits latent topics and relationships among them as a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration. despite advantages over traditional topic modeling , htm poses its own challenges , such as \( 1 \) topic incoherence , \( 2 \) unreasonable \( hierarchical \) structure , and \( 3 \) issues related to the definition of the “ideal” number of topics and depth of the hierarchy. in this paper , we advance the state-of-the-art on htm by means of the design and evaluation of cluhtm , a novel non-probabilistic hierarchical matrix factorization aimed at solving the specific issues of htm. cluhtm’s novel contributions include: \( i \) the exploration of richer text representation that encapsulates both , global \( dataset level \) and local semantic information – when combined , these pieces of information help to solve the topic incoherence problem as well as issues related to the unreasonable structure; \( ii \) the exploitation of a stability analysis metric for defining the number of topics and the “shape” the hierarchical structure. in our evaluation , considering twelve datasets and seven state-of-the-art baselines , cluhtm outperformed the baselines in the vast majority of the cases , with gains of around 500% over the strongest state-of-the-art baselines. we also provide qualitative and quantitative statistical analyses of why our solution works so well.
