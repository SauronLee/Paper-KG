Generalized Entropy Regularization or: There’s Nothing Special about Label Smoothing | Clara Meister | prior work has explored directly regularizing the output distributions of probabilistic models to alleviate peaky \( i.e. over-confident \) predictions , a common sign of overfitting. this class of techniques , of which label smoothing is one , has a connection to entropy regularization. despite the consistent success of label smoothing across architectures and data sets in language generation tasks , two problems remain open: \( 1 \) there is little understanding of the underlying effects entropy regularizers have on models , and \( 2 \) the full space of entropy regularization techniques is largely unexplored. we introduce a parametric family of entropy regularizers , which includes label smoothing as a special case , and use it to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the entropy of a model and its performance on language generation tasks. we also find that variance in model performance can be explained largely by the resulting entropy of the model. lastly , we find that label smoothing provably does not allow for sparsity in an output distribution , an undesirable property for language generation models , and therefore advise the use of other entropy regularization methods in its place.
