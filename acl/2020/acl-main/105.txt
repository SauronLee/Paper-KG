A Graph Auto-encoder Model of Derivational Morphology | Valentin Hofmann | there has been little work on modeling the morphological well-formedness \( mwf \) of derivatives , a problem judged to be complex and difficult in linguistics. we present a graph auto-encoder that learns embeddings capturing information about the compatibility of affixes and stems in derivation. the auto-encoder models mwf in english surprisingly well by combining syntactic and semantic information with associative information from the mental lexicon.
