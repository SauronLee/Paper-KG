Image-Chat: Engaging Grounded Conversations | Kurt Shuster | to achieve the long-term goal of machines being able to engage humans in conversation , our models should captivate the interest of their speaking partners. communication grounded in images , whereby a dialogue is conducted based on a given photo , is a setup naturally appealing to humans \( hu et al. , 2014 \) . in this work we study large-scale architectures and datasets for this goal. we test a set of neural architectures using state-of-the-art image and text representations , considering various ways to fuse the components. to test such models , we collect a dataset of grounded human-human conversations , where speakers are asked to play roles given a provided emotional mood or style , as the use of such traits is also a key factor in engagingness \( guo et al. , 2019 \) . our dataset , image-chat , consists of 202k dialogues over 202k images using 215 possible style traits. automatic metrics and human evaluations of engagingness show the efficacy of our approach; in particular , we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the existing igc task , and our best performing model is almost on par with humans on the image-chat test set \( preferred 47.7% of the time \) .
