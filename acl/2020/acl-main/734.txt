Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-speech Tagging via Two-way Attentions of Auto-analyzed Knowledge | Yuanhe Tian | chinese word segmentation \( cws \) and part-of-speech \( pos \) tagging are important fundamental tasks for chinese language processing , where joint learning of them is an effective one-step solution for both tasks. previous studies for joint cws and pos tagging mainly follow the character-based tagging paradigm with introducing contextual information such as n-gram features or sentential representations from recurrent neural models. however , for many cases , the joint tagging needs not only modeling from context features but also knowledge attached to them \( e.g. , syntactic relations among words \) ; limited efforts have been made by existing research to meet such needs. in this paper , we propose a neural model named twasp for joint cws and pos tagging following the character-based sequence labeling paradigm , where a two-way attention mechanism is used to incorporate both context feature and their corresponding syntactic knowledge for each input character. particularly , we use existing language processing toolkits to obtain the auto-analyzed syntactic knowledge for the context , and the proposed attention module can learn and benefit from them although their quality may not be perfect. our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the two-way attentions for joint cws and pos tagging , where state-of-the-art performance is achieved on five benchmark datasets.
