Discrete Optimization for Unsupervised Sentence Summarization with Word-Level Extraction | Raphael Schumann | automatic sentence summarization produces a shorter version of a sentence , while preserving its most important information. a good summary is characterized by language fluency and high information overlap with the source sentence. we model these two aspects in an unsupervised objective function , consisting of language modeling and semantic similarity metrics. we search for a high-scoring summary by discrete optimization. our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the art for unsupervised sentence summarization according to rouge scores. additionally , we demonstrate that the commonly reported rouge f1 metric is sensitive to summary length. since this is unwillingly exploited in recent work , we emphasize that future evaluation should explicitly group summarization systems by output length brackets.
