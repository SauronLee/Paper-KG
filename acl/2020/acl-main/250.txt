ENGINE: Energy-Based Inference Networks for Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation | Lifu Tu | we propose to train a non-autoregressive machine translation model to minimize the energy defined by a pretrained autoregressive model. in particular , we view our non-autoregressive translation system as an inference network \( tu and gimpel , 2018 \) trained to minimize the autoregressive teacher energy. this contrasts with the popular approach of training a non-autoregressive model on a distilled corpus consisting of the beam-searched outputs of such a teacher model. our approach , which we call engine \( energy-based inference networks \) , achieves state-of-the-art non-autoregressive results on the iwslt 2014 de-en and wmt 2016 ro-en datasets , approaching the performance of autoregressive models.
