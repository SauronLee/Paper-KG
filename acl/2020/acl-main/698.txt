On Forgetting to Cite Older Papers: An Analysis of the ACL Anthology | Marcel Bollmann | the field of natural language processing is experiencing a period of unprecedented growth , and with it a surge of published papers. this represents an opportunity for us to take stock of how we cite the work of other researchers , and whether this growth comes at the expense of “forgetting” about older literature. in this paper , we address this question through bibliographic analysis. by looking at the age of outgoing citations in papers published at selected acl venues between 2010 and 2019 , we find that there is indeed a tendency for recent papers to cite more recent work , but the rate at which papers older than 15 years are cited has remained relatively stable.
