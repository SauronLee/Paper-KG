Fact-based Content Weighting for Evaluating Abstractive Summarisation | Xinnuo Xu | abstractive summarisation is notoriously hard to evaluate since standard word-overlap-based metrics are insufficient. we introduce a new evaluation metric which is based on fact-level content weighting , i.e. relating the facts of the document to the facts of the summary. we fol- low the assumption that a good summary will reflect all relevant facts , i.e. the ones present in the ground truth \( human-generated refer- ence summary \) . we confirm this hypothe- sis by showing that our weightings are highly correlated to human perception and compare favourably to the recent manual highlight- based metric of hardy et al. \( 2019 \) .
