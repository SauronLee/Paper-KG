Clinical Concept Linking with Contextualized Neural Representations | Elliot Schumacher | in traditional approaches to entity linking , linking decisions are based on three sources of information – the similarity of the mention string to an entity’s name , the similarity of the context of the document to the entity , and broader information about the knowledge base \( kb \) . in some domains , there is little contextual information present in the kb and thus we rely more heavily on mention string similarity. we consider one example of this , concept linking , which seeks to link mentions of medical concepts to a medical concept ontology. we propose an approach to concept linking that leverages recent work in contextualized neural models , such as elmo \( peters et al. 2018 \) , which create a token representation that integrates the surrounding context of the mention and concept name. we find a neural ranking approach paired with contextualized embeddings provides gains over a competitive baseline \( leaman et al. 2013 \) . additionally , we find that a pre-training step using synonyms from the ontology offers a useful initialization for the ranker.
