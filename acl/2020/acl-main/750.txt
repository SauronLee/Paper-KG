TXtract: Taxonomy-Aware Knowledge Extraction for Thousands of Product Categories | Giannis Karamanolakis | extracting structured knowledge from product profiles is crucial for various applications in e-commerce. state-of-the-art approaches for knowledge extraction were each designed for a single category of product , and thus do not apply to real-life e-commerce scenarios , which often contain thousands of diverse categories. this paper proposes txtract , a taxonomy-aware knowledge extraction model that applies to thousands of product categories organized in a hierarchical taxonomy. through category conditional self-attention and multi-task learning , our approach is both scalable , as it trains a single model for thousands of categories , and effective , as it extracts category-specific attribute values. experiments on products from a taxonomy with 4 , 000 categories show that txtract outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by up to 10% in f1 and 15% in coverage across all categories.
