DRTS Parsing with Structure-Aware Encoding and Decoding | Qiankun Fu | discourse representation tree structure \( drts \) parsing is a novel semantic parsing task which has been concerned most recently. state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by a neural sequence-to-sequence model , treating the tree construction as an incremental sequence generation problem. structural information such as input syntax and the intermediate skeleton of the partial output has been ignored in the model , which could be potentially useful for the drts parsing. in this work , we propose a structural-aware model at both the encoder and decoder phase to integrate the structural information , where graph attention network \( gat \) is exploited for effectively modeling. experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed model is effective and can obtain the best performance in the literature.
