An Effective Transition-based Model for Discontinuous NER | Xiang Dai | unlike widely used named entity recognition \( ner \) data sets in generic domains , biomedical ner data sets often contain mentions consisting of discontinuous spans. conventional sequence tagging techniques encode markov assumptions that are efficient but preclude recovery of these mentions. we propose a simple , effective transition-based model with generic neural encoding for discontinuous ner. through extensive experiments on three biomedical data sets , we show that our model can effectively recognize discontinuous mentions without sacrificing the accuracy on continuous mentions.
