MOOCCube: A Large-scale Data Repository for NLP Applications in MOOCs | Jifan Yu | the prosperity of massive open online courses \( moocs \) provides fodder for many nlp and ai research for education applications , e.g. , course concept extraction , prerequisite relation discovery , etc. however , the publicly available datasets of mooc are limited in size with few types of data , which hinders advanced models and novel attempts in related topics. therefore , we present mooccube , a large-scale data repository of over 700 mooc courses , 100k concepts , 8 million student behaviors with an external resource. moreover , we conduct a prerequisite discovery task as an example application to show the potential of mooccube in facilitating relevant research. the data repository is now available at http://moocdata.cn/data/mooccube.
