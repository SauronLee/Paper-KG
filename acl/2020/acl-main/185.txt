Recursive Template-based Frame Generation for Task Oriented Dialog | Rashmi Gangadharaiah | the natural language understanding \( nlu \) component in task oriented dialog systems processes a userâ€™s request and converts it into structured information that can be consumed by downstream components such as the dialog state tracker \( dst \) . this information is typically represented as a semantic frame that captures the intent and slot-labels provided by the user. we first show that such a shallow representation is insufficient for complex dialog scenarios , because it does not capture the recursive nature inherent in many domains. we propose a recursive , hierarchical frame-based representation and show how to learn it from data. we formulate the frame generation task as a template-based tree decoding task , where the decoder recursively generates a template and then fills slot values into the template. we extend local tree-based loss functions with terms that provide global supervision and show how to optimize them end-to-end. we achieve a small improvement on the widely used atis dataset and a much larger improvement on a more complex dataset we describe here.
