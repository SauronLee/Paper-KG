Opportunistic Decoding with Timely Correction for Simultaneous Translation | Renjie Zheng | simultaneous translation has many important application scenarios and attracts much attention from both academia and industry recently. most existing frameworks , however , have difficulties in balancing between the translation quality and latency , i.e. , the decoding policy is usually either too aggressive or too conservative. we propose an opportunistic decoding technique with timely correction ability , which always \( over- \) generates a certain mount of extra words at each step to keep the audience on track with the latest information. at the same time , it also corrects , in a timely fashion , the mistakes in the former overgenerated words when observing more source context to ensure high translation quality. experiments show our technique achieves substantial reduction in latency and up to +3.1 increase in bleu , with revision rate under 8% in chinese-to-english and english-to-chinese translation.
