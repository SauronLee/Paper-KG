Dialogue State Tracking with Explicit Slot Connection Modeling | Yawen Ouyang | recent proposed approaches have made promising progress in dialogue state tracking \( dst \) . however , in multi-domain scenarios , ellipsis and reference are frequently adopted by users to express values that have been mentioned by slots from other domains. to handle these phenomena , we propose a dialogue state tracking with slot connections \( dst-sc \) model to explicitly consider slot correlations across different domains. given a target slot , the slot connecting mechanism in dst-sc can infer its source slot and copy the source slot value directly , thus significantly reducing the difficulty of learning and reasoning. experimental results verify the benefits of explicit slot connection modeling , and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiwoz 2.0 and multiwoz 2.1 datasets.
