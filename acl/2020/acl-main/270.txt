Single Model Ensemble using Pseudo-Tags and Distinct Vectors | Ryosuke Kuwabara | model ensemble techniques often increase task performance in neural networks; however , they require increased time , memory , and management effort. in this study , we propose a novel method that replicates the effects of a model ensemble with a single model. our approach creates k-virtual models within a single parameter space using k-distinct pseudo-tags and k-distinct vectors. experiments on text classification and sequence labeling tasks on several datasets demonstrate that our method emulates or outperforms a traditional model ensemble with 1/k-times fewer parameters.
