A Re-evaluation of Knowledge Graph Completion Methods | Zhiqing Sun | knowledge graph completion \( kgc \) aims at automatically predicting missing links for large-scale knowledge graphs. a vast number of state-of-the-art kgc techniques have got published at top conferences in several research fields , including data mining , machine learning , and natural language processing. however , we notice that several recent papers report very high performance , which largely outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. in this paper , we find that this can be attributed to the inappropriate evaluation protocol used by them and propose a simple evaluation protocol to address this problem. the proposed protocol is robust to handle bias in the model , which can substantially affect the final results. we conduct extensive experiments and report performance of several existing methods using our protocol. the reproducible code has been made publicly available.
