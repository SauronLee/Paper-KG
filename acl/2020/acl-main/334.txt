Biomedical Entity Representations with Synonym Marginalization | Mujeen Sung | biomedical named entities often play important roles in many biomedical text mining tools. however , due to the incompleteness of provided synonyms and numerous variations in their surface forms , normalization of biomedical entities is very challenging. in this paper , we focus on learning representations of biomedical entities solely based on the synonyms of entities. to learn from the incomplete synonyms , we use a model-based candidate selection and maximize the marginal likelihood of the synonyms present in top candidates. our model-based candidates are iteratively updated to contain more difficult negative samples as our model evolves. in this way , we avoid the explicit pre-selection of negative samples from more than 400k candidates. on four biomedical entity normalization datasets having three different entity types \( disease , chemical , adverse reaction \) , our model biosyn consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models almost reaching the upper bound on each dataset.
