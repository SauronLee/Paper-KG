Analysing Lexical Semantic Change with Contextualised Word Representations | Mario Giulianelli | this paper presents the first unsupervised approach to lexical semantic change that makes use of contextualised word representations. we propose a novel method that exploits the bert neural language model to obtain representations of word usages , clusters these representations into usage types , and measures change along time with three proposed metrics. we create a new evaluation dataset and show that the model representations and the detected semantic shifts are positively correlated with human judgements. our extensive qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method captures a variety of synchronic and diachronic linguistic phenomena. we expect our work to inspire further research in this direction.
