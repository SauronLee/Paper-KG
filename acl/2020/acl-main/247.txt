Topological Sort for Sentence Ordering | Shrimai Prabhumoye | sentence ordering is the task of arranging the sentences of a given text in the correct order. recent work using deep neural networks for this task has framed it as a sequence prediction problem. in this paper , we propose a new framing of this task as a constraint solving problem and introduce a new technique to solve it. additionally , we propose a human evaluation for this task. the results on both automatic and human metrics across four different datasets show that this new technique is better at capturing coherence in documents.
