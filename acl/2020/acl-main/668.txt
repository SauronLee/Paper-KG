Revisiting Unsupervised Relation Extraction | Thy Thy Tran | unsupervised relation extraction \( ure \) extracts relations between named entities from raw text without manually-labelled data and existing knowledge bases \( kbs \) . ure methods can be categorised into generative and discriminative approaches , which rely either on hand-crafted features or surface form. however , we demonstrate that by using only named entities to induce relation types , we can outperform existing methods on two popular datasets. we conduct a comparison and evaluation of our findings with other ure techniques , to ascertain the important features in ure. we conclude that entity types provide a strong inductive bias for ure.
