Extracting Headless MWEs from Dependency Parse Trees: Parsing, Tagging, and Joint Modeling Approaches | Tianze Shi | an interesting and frequent type of multi-word expression \( mwe \) is the headless mwe , for which there are no true internal syntactic dominance relations; examples include many named entities \( “wells fargo” \) and dates \( “july 5 , 2020” \) as well as certain productive constructions \( “blow for blow” , “day after day” \) . despite their special status and prevalence , current dependency-annotation schemes require treating such flat structures as if they had internal syntactic heads , and most current parsers handle them in the same fashion as headed constructions. meanwhile , outside the context of parsing , taggers are typically used for identifying mwes , but taggers might benefit from structural information. we empirically compare these two common strategies—parsing and tagging—for predicting flat mwes. additionally , we propose an efficient joint decoding algorithm that combines scores from both strategies. experimental results on the mwe-aware english dependency corpus and on six non-english dependency treebanks with frequent flat structures show that: \( 1 \) tagging is more accurate than parsing for identifying flat-structure mwes , \( 2 \) our joint decoder reconciles the two different views and , for non-bert features , leads to higher accuracies , and \( 3 \) most of the gains result from feature sharing between the parsers and taggers.
