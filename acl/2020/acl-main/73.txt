Unsupervised FAQ Retrieval with Question Generation and BERT | Yosi Mass | we focus on the task of frequently asked questions \( faq \) retrieval. a given user query can be matched against the questions and/or the answers in the faq. we present a fully unsupervised method that exploits the faq pairs to train two bert models. the two models match user queries to faq answers and questions , respectively. we alleviate the missing labeled data of the latter by automatically generating high-quality question paraphrases. we show that our model is on par and even outperforms supervised models on existing datasets.
