Universal Decompositional Semantic Parsing | Elias Stengel-Eskin | we introduce a transductive model for parsing into universal decompositional semantics \( uds \) representations , which jointly learns to map natural language utterances into uds graph structures and annotate the graph with decompositional semantic attribute scores. we also introduce a strong pipeline model for parsing into the uds graph structure , and show that our transductive parser performs comparably while additionally performing attribute prediction. by analyzing the attribute prediction errors , we find the model captures natural relationships between attribute groups.
