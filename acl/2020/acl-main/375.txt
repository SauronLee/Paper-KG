Enriched In-Order Linearization for Faster Sequence-to-Sequence Constituent Parsing | Daniel Fernández-González | sequence-to-sequence constituent parsing requires a linearization to represent trees as sequences. top-down tree linearizations , which can be based on brackets or shift-reduce actions , have achieved the best accuracy to date. in this paper , we show that these results can be improved by using an in-order linearization instead. based on this observation , we implement an enriched in-order shift-reduce linearization inspired by vinyals et al. \( 2015 \) ’s approach , achieving the best accuracy to date on the english ptb dataset among fully-supervised single-model sequence-to-sequence constituent parsers. finally , we apply deterministic attention mechanisms to match the speed of state-of-the-art transition-based parsers , thus showing that sequence-to-sequence models can match them , not only in accuracy , but also in speed.
