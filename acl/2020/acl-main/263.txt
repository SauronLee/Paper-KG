Mitigating Gender Bias Amplification in Distribution by Posterior Regularization | Shengyu Jia | advanced machine learning techniques have boosted the performance of natural language processing. nevertheless , recent studies , e.g. , \( citation \) show that these techniques inadvertently capture the societal bias hidden in the corpus and further amplify it. however , their analysis is conducted only on modelsâ€™ top predictions. in this paper , we investigate the gender bias amplification issue from the distribution perspective and demonstrate that the bias is amplified in the view of predicted probability distribution over labels. we further propose a bias mitigation approach based on posterior regularization. with little performance loss , our method can almost remove the bias amplification in the distribution. our study sheds the light on understanding the bias amplification.
