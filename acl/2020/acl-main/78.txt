Interpreting Twitter User Geolocation | Ting Zhong | identifying user geolocation in online social networks is an essential task in many location-based applications. existing methods rely on the similarity of text and network structure , however , they suffer from a lack of interpretability on the corresponding results , which is crucial for understanding model behavior. in this work , we adopt influence functions to interpret the behavior of gnn-based models by identifying the importance of training users when predicting the locations of the testing users. this methodology helps with providing meaningful explanations on prediction results. furthermore , it also initiates an attempt to uncover the so-called “black-box” gnn-based models by investigating the effect of individual nodes.
