Exploiting Personal Characteristics of Debaters for Predicting Persuasiveness | Khalid Al Khatib | predicting the persuasiveness of arguments has applications as diverse as writing assistance , essay scoring , and advertising. while clearly relevant to the task , the personal characteristics of an argument’s source and audience have not yet been fully exploited toward automated persuasiveness prediction. in this paper , we model debaters’ prior beliefs , interests , and personality traits based on their previous activity , without dependence on explicit user profiles or questionnaires. using a dataset of over 60 , 000 argumentative discussions , comprising more than three million individual posts collected from the subreddit r/changemyview , we demonstrate that our modeling of debater’s characteristics enhances the prediction of argument persuasiveness as well as of debaters’ resistance to persuasion.
