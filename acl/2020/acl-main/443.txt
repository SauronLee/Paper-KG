Dialogue-Based Relation Extraction | Dian Yu | we present the first human-annotated dialogue-based relation extraction \( re \) dataset dialogre , aiming to support the prediction of relation \( s \) between two arguments that appear in a dialogue. we further offer dialogre as a platform for studying cross-sentence re as most facts span multiple sentences. we argue that speaker-related information plays a critical role in the proposed task , based on an analysis of similarities and differences between dialogue-based and traditional re tasks. considering the timeliness of communication in a dialogue , we design a new metric to evaluate the performance of re methods in a conversational setting and investigate the performance of several representative re methods on dialogre. experimental results demonstrate that a speaker-aware extension on the best-performing model leads to gains in both the standard and conversational evaluation settings. dialogre is available at https://dataset.org/dialogre/.
