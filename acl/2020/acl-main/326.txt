Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation using Source Language Inputs and Cross-lingual Language Model | Kosuke Takahashi | we propose an automatic evaluation method of machine translation that uses source language sentences regarded as additional pseudo references. the proposed method evaluates a translation hypothesis in a regression model. the model takes the paired source , reference , and hypothesis sentence all together as an input. a pretrained large scale cross-lingual language model encodes the input to sentence-pair vectors , and the model predicts a human evaluation score with those vectors. our experiments show that our proposed method using cross-lingual language model \( xlm \) trained with a translation language modeling \( tlm \) objective achieves a higher correlation with human judgments than a baseline method that uses only hypothesis and reference sentences. additionally , using source sentences in our proposed method is confirmed to improve the evaluation performance.
