Leveraging Graph to Improve Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization | Wei Li | graphs that capture relations between textual units have great benefits for detecting salient information from multiple documents and generating overall coherent summaries. in this paper , we develop a neural abstractive multi-document summarization \( mds \) model which can leverage well-known graph representations of documents such as similarity graph and discourse graph , to more effectively process multiple input documents and produce abstractive summaries. our model utilizes graphs to encode documents in order to capture cross-document relations , which is crucial to summarizing long documents. our model can also take advantage of graphs to guide the summary generation process , which is beneficial for generating coherent and concise summaries. furthermore , pre-trained language models can be easily combined with our model , which further improve the summarization performance significantly. empirical results on the wikisum and multinews dataset show that the proposed architecture brings substantial improvements over several strong baselines.
