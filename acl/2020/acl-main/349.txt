SimulSpeech: End-to-End Simultaneous Speech to Text Translation | Yi Ren | in this work , we develop simulspeech , an end-to-end simultaneous speech to text translation system which translates speech in source language to text in target language concurrently. simulspeech consists of a speech encoder , a speech segmenter and a text decoder , where 1 \) the segmenter builds upon the encoder and leverages a connectionist temporal classification \( ctc \) loss to split the input streaming speech in real time , 2 \) the encoder-decoder attention adopts a wait-
