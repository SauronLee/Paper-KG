Code and Named Entity Recognition in StackOverflow | Jeniya Tabassum | there is an increasing interest in studying natural language and computer code together , as large corpora of programming texts become readily available on the internet. for example , stackoverflow currently has over 15 million programming related questions written by 8.5 million users. meanwhile , there is still a lack of fundamental nlp techniques for identifying code tokens or software-related named entities that appear within natural language sentences. in this paper , we introduce a new named entity recognition \( ner \) corpus for the computer programming domain , consisting of 15 , 372 sentences annotated with 20 fine-grained entity types. we trained in-domain bert representations \( bertoverflow \) on 152 million sentences from stackoverflow , which lead to an absolute increase of +10 f1 score over off-the-shelf bert. we also present the softner model which achieves an overall 79.10 f-1 score for code and named entity recognition on stackoverflow data. our softner model incorporates a context-independent code token classifier with corpus-level features to improve the bert-based tagging model. our code and data are available at: https://github.com/jeniyat/stackoverflowner/
