Automatic Poetry Generation from Prosaic Text | Tim Van de Cruys | in the last few years , a number of successful approaches have emerged that are able to adequately model various aspects of natural language. in particular , language models based on neural networks have improved the state of the art with regard to predictive language modeling , while topic models are successful at capturing clear-cut , semantic dimensions. in this paper , we will explore how these approaches can be adapted and combined to model the linguistic and literary aspects needed for poetry generation. the system is exclusively trained on standard , non-poetic text , and its output is constrained in order to confer a poetic character to the generated verse. the framework is applied to the generation of poems in both english and french , and is equally evaluated for both languages. even though it only uses standard , non-poetic text as input , the system yields state of the art results for poetry generation.
