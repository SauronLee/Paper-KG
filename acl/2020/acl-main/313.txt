Do you have the right scissors? Tailoring Pre-trained Language Models via Monte-Carlo Methods | Ning Miao | it has been a common approach to pre-train a language model on a large corpus and fine-tune it on task-specific data. in practice , we observe that fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a small dataset may lead to over- and/or under-estimate problem. in this paper , we propose mc-tailor , a novel method to alleviate the above issue in text generation tasks by truncating and transferring the probability mass from over-estimated regions to under-estimated ones. experiments on a variety of text generation datasets show that mc-tailor consistently and significantly outperforms the fine-tuning approach.
