Unsupervised Alignment-based Iterative Evidence Retrieval for Multi-hop Question Answering | Vikas Yadav | evidence retrieval is a critical stage of question answering \( qa \) , necessary not only to improve performance , but also to explain the decisions of the qa method. we introduce a simple , fast , and unsupervised iterative evidence retrieval method , which relies on three ideas: \( a \) an unsupervised alignment approach to soft-align questions and answers with justification sentences using only glove embeddings , \( b \) an iterative process that reformulates queries focusing on terms that are not covered by existing justifications , which \( c \) stops when the terms in the given question and candidate answers are covered by the retrieved justifications. despite its simplicity , our approach outperforms all the previous methods \( including supervised methods \) on the evidence selection task on two datasets: multirc and qasc. when these evidence sentences are fed into a roberta answer classification component , we achieve state-of-the-art qa performance on these two datasets.
