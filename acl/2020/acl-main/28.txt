A Joint Model for Document Segmentation and Segment Labeling | Joe Barrow | text segmentation aims to uncover latent structure by dividing text from a document into coherent sections. where previous work on text segmentation considers the tasks of document segmentation and segment labeling separately , we show that the tasks contain complementary information and are best addressed jointly. we introduce segment pooling lstm \( s-lstm \) , which is capable of jointly segmenting a document and labeling segments. in support of joint training , we develop a method for teaching the model to recover from errors by aligning the predicted and ground truth segments. we show that s-lstm reduces segmentation error by 30% on average , while also improving segment labeling.
