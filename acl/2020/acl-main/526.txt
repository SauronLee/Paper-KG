Relabel the Noise: Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations via Cooperative Multiagents | Daoyuan Chen | distant supervision based methods for entity and relation extraction have received increasing popularity due to the fact that these methods require light human annotation efforts. in this paper , we consider the problem of shifted label distribution , which is caused by the inconsistency between the noisy-labeled training set subject to external knowledge graph and the human-annotated test set , and exacerbated by the pipelined entity-then-relation extraction manner with noise propagation. we propose a joint extraction approach to address this problem by re-labeling noisy instances with a group of cooperative multiagents. to handle noisy instances in a fine-grained manner , each agent in the cooperative group evaluates the instance by calculating a continuous confidence score from its own perspective; to leverage the correlations between these two extraction tasks , a confidence consensus module is designed to gather the wisdom of all agents and re-distribute the noisy training set with confidence-scored labels. further , the confidences are used to adjust the training losses of extractors. experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the benefits of re-labeling noisy instance , and show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art entity and relation extraction methods.
