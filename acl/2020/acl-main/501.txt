SCDE: Sentence Cloze Dataset with High Quality Distractors From Examinations | Xiang Kong | we introduce scde , a dataset to evaluate the performance of computational models through sentence prediction. scde is a human created sentence cloze dataset , collected from public school english examinations. our task requires a model to fill up multiple blanks in a passage from a shared candidate set with distractors designed by english teachers. experimental results demonstrate that this task requires the use of non-local , discourse-level context beyond the immediate sentence neighborhood. the blanks require joint solving and significantly impair each otherâ€™s context. furthermore , through ablations , we show that the distractors are of high quality and make the task more challenging. our experiments show that there is a significant performance gap between advanced models \( 72% \) and humans \( 87% \) , encouraging future models to bridge this gap.
