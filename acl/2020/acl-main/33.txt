Content Word Aware Neural Machine Translation | Kehai Chen | neural machine translation \( nmt \) encodes the source sentence in a universal way to generate the target sentence word-by-word. however , nmt does not consider the importance of word in the sentence meaning , for example , some words \( i.e. , content words \) express more important meaning than others \( i.e. , function words \) . to address this limitation , we first utilize word frequency information to distinguish between content and function words in a sentence , and then design a content word-aware nmt to improve translation performance. empirical results on the wmt14 english-to-german , wmt14 english-to-french , and wmt17 chinese-to-english translation tasks show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of transformer-based nmt.
