Active Imitation Learning with Noisy Guidance | Kiant√© Brantley | imitation learning algorithms provide state-of-the-art results on many structured prediction tasks by learning near-optimal search policies. such algorithms assume training-time access to an expert that can provide the optimal action at any queried state; unfortunately , the number of such queries is often prohibitive , frequently rendering these approaches impractical. to combat this query complexity , we consider an active learning setting in which the learning algorithm has additional access to a much cheaper noisy heuristic that provides noisy guidance. our algorithm , leaqi , learns a difference classifier that predicts when the expert is likely to disagree with the heuristic , and queries the expert only when necessary. we apply leaqi to three sequence labelling tasks , demonstrating significantly fewer queries to the expert and comparable \( or better \) accuracies over a passive approach.
