ASSET: A Dataset for Tuning and Evaluation of Sentence Simplification Models with Multiple Rewriting Transformations | Fernando Alva-Manchego | in order to simplify a sentence , human editors perform multiple rewriting transformations: they split it into several shorter sentences , paraphrase words \( i.e. replacing complex words or phrases by simpler synonyms \) , reorder components , and/or delete information deemed unnecessary. despite these varied range of possible text alterations , current models for automatic sentence simplification are evaluated using datasets that are focused on a single transformation , such as lexical paraphrasing or splitting. this makes it impossible to understand the ability of simplification models in more realistic settings. to alleviate this limitation , this paper introduces asset , a new dataset for assessing sentence simplification in english. asset is a crowdsourced multi-reference corpus where each simplification was produced by executing several rewriting transformations. through quantitative and qualitative experiments , we show that simplifications in asset are better at capturing characteristics of simplicity when compared to other standard evaluation datasets for the task. furthermore , we motivate the need for developing better methods for automatic evaluation using asset , since we show that current popular metrics may not be suitable when multiple simplification transformations are performed.
