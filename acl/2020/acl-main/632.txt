Out of the Echo Chamber: Detecting Countering Debate Speeches | Matan Orbach | an educated and informed consumption of media content has become a challenge in modern times. with the shift from traditional news outlets to social media and similar venues , a major concern is that readers are becoming encapsulated in “echo chambers” and may fall prey to fake news and disinformation , lacking easy access to dissenting views. we suggest a novel task aiming to alleviate some of these concerns – that of detecting articles that most effectively counter the arguments – and not just the stance – made in a given text. we study this problem in the context of debate speeches. given such a speech , we aim to identify , from among a set of speeches on the same topic and with an opposing stance , the ones that directly counter it. we provide a large dataset of 3 , 685 such speeches \( in english \) , annotated for this relation , which hopefully would be of general interest to the nlp community. we explore several algorithms addressing this task , and while some are successful , all fall short of expert human performance , suggesting room for further research. all data collected during this work is freely available for research.
