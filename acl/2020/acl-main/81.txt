Spelling Error Correction with Soft-Masked BERT | Shaohua Zhang | spelling error correction is an important yet challenging task because a satisfactory solution of it essentially needs human-level language understanding ability. without loss of generality we consider chinese spelling error correction \( csc \) in this paper. a state-of-the-art method for the task selects a character from a list of candidates for correction \( including non-correction \) at each position of the sentence on the basis of bert , the language representation model. the accuracy of the method can be sub-optimal , however , because bert does not have sufficient capability to detect whether there is an error at each position , apparently due to the way of pre-training it using mask language modeling. in this work , we propose a novel neural architecture to address the aforementioned issue , which consists of a network for error detection and a network for error correction based on bert , with the former being connected to the latter with what we call soft-masking technique. our method of using ‘soft-masked bert’ is general , and it may be employed in other language detection-correction problems. experimental results on two datasets , including one large dataset which we create and plan to release , demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is significantly better than the baselines including the one solely based on bert.
