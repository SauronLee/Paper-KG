Dynamic Sampling Strategies for Multi-Task Reading Comprehension | Ananth Gottumukkala | building general reading comprehension systems , capable of solving multiple datasets at the same time , is a recent aspirational goal in the research community. prior work has focused on model architecture or generalization to held out datasets , and largely passed over the particulars of the multi-task learning set up. we show that a simple dynamic sampling strategy , selecting instances for training proportional to the multi-task modelâ€™s current performance on a dataset relative to its single task performance , gives substantive gains over prior multi-task sampling strategies , mitigating the catastrophic forgetting that is common in multi-task learning. we also demonstrate that allowing instances of different tasks to be interleaved as much as possible between each epoch and batch has a clear benefit in multitask performance over forcing task homogeneity at the epoch or batch level. our final model shows greatly increased performance over the best model on orb , a recently-released multitask reading comprehension benchmark.
