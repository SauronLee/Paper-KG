Learning to Ask More: Semi-Autoregressive Sequential Question Generation under Dual-Graph Interaction | Zi Chai | traditional question generation \( tqg \) aims to generate a question given an input passage and an answer. when there is a sequence of answers , we can perform sequential question generation \( sqg \) to produce a series of interconnected questions. since the frequently occurred information omission and coreference between questions , sqg is rather challenging. prior works regarded sqg as a dialog generation task and recurrently produced each question. however , they suffered from problems caused by error cascades and could only capture limited context dependencies. to this end , we generate questions in a semi-autoregressive way. our model divides questions into different groups and generates each group of them in parallel. during this process , it builds two graphs focusing on information from passages , answers respectively and performs dual-graph interaction to get information for generation. besides , we design an answer-aware attention mechanism and the coarse-to-fine generation scenario. experiments on our new dataset containing 81.9k questions show that our model substantially outperforms prior works.
