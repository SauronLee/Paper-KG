Controlled Crowdsourcing for High-Quality QA-SRL Annotation | Paul Roit | question-answer driven semantic role labeling \( qa-srl \) was proposed as an attractive open and natural flavour of srl , potentially attainable from laymen. recently , a large-scale crowdsourced qa-srl corpus and a trained parser were released. trying to replicate the qa-srl annotation for new texts , we found that the resulting annotations were lacking in quality , particularly in coverage , making them insufficient for further research and evaluation. in this paper , we present an improved crowdsourcing protocol for complex semantic annotation , involving worker selection and training , and a data consolidation phase. applying this protocol to qa-srl yielded high-quality annotation with drastically higher coverage , producing a new gold evaluation dataset. we believe that our annotation protocol and gold standard will facilitate future replicable research of natural semantic annotations.
