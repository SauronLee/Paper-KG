Reasoning Over Semantic-Level Graph for Fact Checking | Wanjun Zhong | fact checking is a challenging task because verifying the truthfulness of a claim requires reasoning about multiple retrievable evidence. in this work , we present a method suitable for reasoning about the semantic-level structure of evidence. unlike most previous works , which typically represent evidence sentences with either string concatenation or fusing the features of isolated evidence sentences , our approach operates on rich semantic structures of evidence obtained by semantic role labeling. we propose two mechanisms to exploit the structure of evidence while leveraging the advances of pre-trained models like bert , gpt or xlnet. specifically , using xlnet as the backbone , we first utilize the graph structure to re-define the relative distances of words , with the intuition that semantically related words should have short distances. then , we adopt graph convolutional network and graph attention network to propagate and aggregate information from neighboring nodes on the graph. we evaluate our system on fever , a benchmark dataset for fact checking , and find that rich structural information is helpful and both our graph-based mechanisms improve the accuracy. our model is the state-of-the-art system in terms of both official evaluation metrics , namely claim verification accuracy and fever score.
