AdvAug: Robust Adversarial Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation | Yong Cheng | in this paper , we propose a new adversarial augmentation method for neural machine translation \( nmt \) . the main idea is to minimize the vicinal risk over virtual sentences sampled from two vicinity distributions , in which the crucial one is a novel vicinity distribution for adversarial sentences that describes a smooth interpolated embedding space centered around observed training sentence pairs. we then discuss our approach , advaug , to train nmt models using the embeddings of virtual sentences in sequence-to-sequence learning. experiments on chinese-english , english-french , and english-german translation benchmarks show that advaug achieves significant improvements over thetransformer \( up to 4.9 bleu points \) , and substantially outperforms other data augmentation techniques \( e.g.back-translation \) without using extra corpora.
