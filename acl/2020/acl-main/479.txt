Implicit Discourse Relation Classification: We Need to Talk about Evaluation | Najoung Kim | implicit relation classification on penn discourse treebank \( pdtb \) 2.0 is a common benchmark task for evaluating the understanding of discourse relations. however , the lack of consistency in preprocessing and evaluation poses challenges to fair comparison of results in the literature. in this work , we highlight these inconsistencies and propose an improved evaluation protocol. paired with this protocol , we report strong baseline results from pretrained sentence encoders , which set the new state-of-the-art for pdtb 2.0. furthermore , this work is the first to explore fine-grained relation classification on pdtb 3.0. we expect our work to serve as a point of comparison for future work , and also as an initiative to discuss models of larger context and possible data augmentations for downstream transferability.
