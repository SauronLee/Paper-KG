Text and Causal Inference: A Review of Using Text to Remove Confounding from Causal Estimates | Katherine Keith | many applications of computational social science aim to infer causal conclusions from non-experimental data. such observational data often contains confounders , variables that influence both potential causes and potential effects. unmeasured or latent confounders can bias causal estimates , and this has motivated interest in measuring potential confounders from observed text. for example , an individualâ€™s entire history of social media posts or the content of a news article could provide a rich measurement of multiple confounders.yet , methods and applications for this problem are scattered across different communities and evaluation practices are inconsistent.this review is the first to gather and categorize these examples and provide a guide to data-processing and evaluation decisions. despite increased attention on adjusting for confounding using text , there are still many open problems , which we highlight in this paper.
