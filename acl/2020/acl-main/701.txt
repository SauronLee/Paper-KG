Gender Gap in Natural Language Processing Research: Disparities in Authorship and Citations | Saif M. Mohammad | disparities in authorship and citations across gender can have substantial adverse consequences not just on the disadvantaged genders , but also on the field of study as a whole. measuring gender gaps is a crucial step towards addressing them. in this work , we examine female first author percentages and the citations to their papers in natural language processing \( 1965 to 2019 \) . we determine aggregate-level statistics using an existing manually curated author--gender list as well as first names strongly associated with a gender. we find that only about 29% of first authors are female and only about 25% of last authors are female. notably , this percentage has not improved since the mid 2000s. we also show that , on average , female first authors are cited less than male first authors , even when controlling for experience and area of research. finally , we discuss the ethical considerations involved in automatic demographic analysis.
