Multi-source Meta Transfer for Low Resource Multiple-Choice Question Answering | Ming Yan | multiple-choice question answering \( mcqa \) is one of the most challenging tasks in machine reading comprehension since it requires more advanced reading comprehension skills such as logical reasoning , summarization , and arithmetic operations. unfortunately , most existing mcqa datasets are small in size , which increases the difficulty of model learning and generalization. to address this challenge , we propose a multi-source meta transfer \( mmt \) for low-resource mcqa. in this framework , we first extend meta learning by incorporating multiple training sources to learn a generalized feature representation across domains. to bridge the distribution gap between training sources and the target , we further introduce the meta transfer that can be integrated into the multi-source meta training. more importantly , the proposed mmt is independent of backbone language models. extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of mmt over state-of-the-arts , and continuous improvements can be achieved on different backbone networks on both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation settings.
