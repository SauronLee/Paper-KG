GLUECoS: An Evaluation Benchmark for Code-Switched NLP | Simran Khanuja | code-switching is the use of more than one language in the same conversation or utterance. recently , multilingual contextual embedding models , trained on multiple monolingual corpora , have shown promising results on cross-lingual and multilingual tasks. we present an evaluation benchmark , gluecos , for code-switched languages , that spans several nlp tasks in english-hindi and english-spanish. specifically , our evaluation benchmark includes language identification from text , pos tagging , named entity recognition , sentiment analysis , question answering and a new task for code-switching , natural language inference. we present results on all these tasks using cross-lingual word embedding models and multilingual models. in addition , we fine-tune multilingual models on artificially generated code-switched data. although multilingual models perform significantly better than cross-lingual models , our results show that in most tasks , across both language pairs , multilingual models fine-tuned on code-switched data perform best , showing that multilingual models can be further optimized for code-switching tasks.
