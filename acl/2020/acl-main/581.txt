Synchronous Double-channel Recurrent Network for Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction | Shaowei Chen | opinion entity extraction is a fundamental task in fine-grained opinion mining. related studies generally extract aspects and/or opinion expressions without recognizing the relations between them. however , the relations are crucial for downstream tasks , including sentiment classification , opinion summarization , etc. in this paper , we explore aspect-opinion pair extraction \( aope \) task , which aims at extracting aspects and opinion expressions in pairs. to deal with this task , we propose synchronous double-channel recurrent network \( sdrn \) mainly consisting of an opinion entity extraction unit , a relation detection unit , and a synchronization unit. the opinion entity extraction unit and the relation detection unit are developed as two channels to extract opinion entities and relations simultaneously. furthermore , within the synchronization unit , we design entity synchronization mechanism \( esm \) and relation synchronization mechanism \( rsm \) to enhance the mutual benefit on the above two channels. to verify the performance of sdrn , we manually build three datasets based on semeval 2014 and 2015 benchmarks. extensive experiments demonstrate that sdrn achieves state-of-the-art performances.
