Hierarchical Entity Typing via Multi-level Learning to Rank | Tongfei Chen | we propose a novel method for hierarchical entity classification that embraces ontological structure at both training and during prediction. at training , our novel multi-level learning-to-rank loss compares positive types against negative siblings according to the type tree. during prediction , we define a coarse-to-fine decoder that restricts viable candidates at each level of the ontology based on already predicted parent type \( s \) . our approach significantly outperform prior work on strict accuracy , demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.
