MATINF: A Jointly Labeled Large-Scale Dataset for Classification, Question Answering and Summarization | Canwen Xu | recently , large-scale datasets have vastly facilitated the development in nearly all domains of natural language processing. however , there is currently no cross-task dataset in nlp , which hinders the development of multi-task learning. we propose matinf , the first jointly labeled large-scale dataset for classification , question answering and summarization. matinf contains 1.07 million question-answer pairs with human-labeled categories and user-generated question descriptions. based on such rich information , matinf is applicable for three major nlp tasks , including classification , question answering , and summarization. we benchmark existing methods and a novel multi-task baseline over matinf to inspire further research. our comprehensive comparison and experiments over matinf and other datasets demonstrate the merits held by matinf.
