Language Models as an Alternative Evaluator of Word Order Hypotheses: A Case Study in Japanese | Tatsuki Kuribayashi | we examine a methodology using neural language models \( lms \) for analyzing the word order of language. this lm-based method has the potential to overcome the difficulties existing methods face , such as the propagation of preprocessor errors in count-based methods. in this study , we explore whether the lm-based method is valid for analyzing the word order. as a case study , this study focuses on japanese due to its complex and flexible word order. to validate the lm-based method , we test \( i \) parallels between lms and human word order preference , and \( ii \) consistency of the results obtained using the lm-based method with previous linguistic studies. through our experiments , we tentatively conclude that lms display sufficient word order knowledge for usage as an analysis tool. finally , using the lm-based method , we demonstrate the relationship between the canonical word order and topicalization , which had yet to be analyzed by large-scale experiments.
