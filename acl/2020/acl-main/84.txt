Contextualized Sparse Representations for Real-Time Open-Domain Question Answering | Jinhyuk Lee | open-domain question answering can be formulated as a phrase retrieval problem , in which we can expect huge scalability and speed benefit but often suffer from low accuracy due to the limitation of existing phrase representation models. in this paper , we aim to improve the quality of each phrase embedding by augmenting it with a contextualized sparse representation \( sparc \) . unlike previous sparse vectors that are term-frequency-based \( e.g. , tf-idf \) or directly learned \( only few thousand dimensions \) , we leverage rectified self-attention to indirectly learn sparse vectors in n-gram vocabulary space. by augmenting the previous phrase retrieval model \( seo et al. , 2019 \) with sparc , we show 4%+ improvement in curatedtrec and squad-open. our curatedtrec score is even better than the best known retrieve & read model with at least 45x faster inference speed.
