Logical Natural Language Generation from Open-Domain Tables | Wenhu Chen | neural natural language generation \( nlg \) models have recently shown remarkable progress in fluency and coherence. however , existing studies on neural nlg are primarily focused on surface-level realizations with limited emphasis on logical inference , an important aspect of human thinking and language. in this paper , we suggest a new nlg task where a model is tasked with generating natural language statements that can be
