A Relational Memory-based Embedding Model for Triple Classification and Search Personalization | Dai Quoc Nguyen | knowledge graph embedding methods often suffer from a limitation of memorizing valid triples to predict new ones for triple classification and search personalization problems. to this end , we introduce a novel embedding model , named r-men , that explores a relational memory network to encode potential dependencies in relationship triples. r-men considers each triple as a sequence of 3 input vectors that recurrently interact with a memory using a transformer self-attention mechanism. thus r-men encodes new information from interactions between the memory and each input vector to return a corresponding vector. consequently , r-men feeds these 3 returned vectors to a convolutional neural network-based decoder to produce a scalar score for the triple. experimental results show that our proposed r-men obtains state-of-the-art results on search17 for the search personalization task , and on wn11 and fb13 for the triple classification task.
