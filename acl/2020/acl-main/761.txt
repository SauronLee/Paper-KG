Let Me Choose: From Verbal Context to Font Selection | Amirreza Shirani | in this paper , we aim to learn associations between visual attributes of fonts and the verbal context of the texts they are typically applied to. compared to related work leveraging the surrounding visual context , we choose to focus only on the input text , which can enable new applications for which the text is the only visual element in the document. we introduce a new dataset , containing examples of different topics in social media posts and ads , labeled through crowd-sourcing. due to the subjective nature of the task , multiple fonts might be perceived as acceptable for an input text , which makes this problem challenging. to this end , we investigate different end-to-end models to learn label distributions on crowd-sourced data , to capture inter-subjectivity across all annotations.
