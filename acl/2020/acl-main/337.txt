Aspect Sentiment Classification with Document-level Sentiment Preference Modeling | Xiao Chen | in the literature , existing studies always consider aspect sentiment classification \( asc \) as an independent sentence-level classification problem aspect by aspect , which largely ignore the document-level sentiment preference information , though obviously such information is crucial for alleviating the information deficiency problem in asc. in this paper , we explore two kinds of sentiment preference information inside a document , i.e. , contextual sentiment consistency w.r.t. the same aspect \( namely intra-aspect sentiment consistency \) and contextual sentiment tendency w.r.t. all the related aspects \( namely inter-aspect sentiment tendency \) . on the basis , we propose a cooperative graph attention networks \( cogan \) approach for cooperatively learning the aspect-related sentence representation. specifically , two graph attention networks are leveraged to model above two kinds of document-level sentiment preference information respectively , followed by an interactive mechanism to integrate the two-fold preference. detailed evaluation demonstrates the great advantage of the proposed approach to asc over the state-of-the-art baselines. this justifies the importance of the document-level sentiment preference information to asc and the effectiveness of our approach capturing such information.
