The SOFC-Exp Corpus and Neural Approaches to Information Extraction in the Materials Science Domain | Annemarie Friedrich | this paper presents a new challenging information extraction task in the domain of materials science. we develop an annotation scheme for marking information on experiments related to solid oxide fuel cells in scientific publications , such as involved materials and measurement conditions. with this paper , we publish our annotation guidelines , as well as our sofc-exp corpus consisting of 45 open-access scholarly articles annotated by domain experts. a corpus and an inter-annotator agreement study demonstrate the complexity of the suggested named entity recognition and slot filling tasks as well as high annotation quality. we also present strong neural-network based models for a variety of tasks that can be addressed on the basis of our new data set. on all tasks , using bert embeddings leads to large performance gains , but with increasing task complexity , adding a recurrent neural network on top seems beneficial. our models will serve as competitive baselines in future work , and analysis of their performance highlights difficult cases when modeling the data and suggests promising research directions.
