Review-based Question Generation with Adaptive Instance Transfer and Augmentation | Qian Yu | while online reviews of products and services become an important information source , it remains inefficient for potential consumers to exploit verbose reviews for fulfilling their information need. we propose to explore question generation as a new way of review information exploitation , namely generating questions that can be answered by the corresponding review sentences. one major challenge of this generation task is the lack of training data , i.e. explicit mapping relation between the user-posed questions and review sentences. to obtain proper training instances for the generation model , we propose an iterative learning framework with adaptive instance transfer and augmentation. to generate to the point questions about the major aspects in reviews , related features extracted in an unsupervised manner are incorporated without the burden of aspect annotation. experiments on data from various categories of a popular e-commerce site demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework , as well as the potentials of the proposed review-based question generation task.
