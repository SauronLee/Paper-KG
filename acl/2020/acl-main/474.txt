Text-Based Ideal Points | Keyon Vafa | ideal point models analyze lawmakersâ€™ votes to quantify their political positions , or ideal points. but votes are not the only way to express a political position. lawmakers also give speeches , release press statements , and post tweets. in this paper , we introduce the text-based ideal point model \( tbip \) , an unsupervised probabilistic topic model that analyzes texts to quantify the political positions of its authors. we demonstrate the tbip with two types of politicized text data: u.s. senate speeches and senator tweets. though the model does not analyze their votes or political affiliations , the tbip separates lawmakers by party , learns interpretable politicized topics , and infers ideal points close to the classical vote-based ideal points. one benefit of analyzing texts , as opposed to votes , is that the tbip can estimate ideal points of anyone who authors political texts , including non-voting actors. to this end , we use it to study tweets from the 2020 democratic presidential candidates. using only the texts of their tweets , it identifies them along an interpretable progressive-to-moderate spectrum.
