Joint Diacritization, Lemmatization, Normalization, and Fine-Grained Morphological Tagging | Nasser Zalmout | the written forms of semitic languages are both highly ambiguous and morphologically rich: a word can have multiple interpretations and is one of many inflected forms of the same concept or lemma. this is further exacerbated for dialectal content , which is more prone to noise and lacks a standard orthography. the morphological features can be lexicalized , like lemmas and diacritized forms , or non-lexicalized , like gender , number , and part-of-speech tags , among others. joint modeling of the lexicalized and non-lexicalized features can identify more intricate morphological patterns , which provide better context modeling , and further disambiguate ambiguous lexical choices. however , the different modeling granularity can make joint modeling more difficult. our approach models the different features jointly , whether lexicalized \( on the character-level \) , or non-lexicalized \( on the word-level \) . we use arabic as a test case , and achieve state-of-the-art results for modern standard arabic with 20% relative error reduction , and egyptian arabic with 11% relative error reduction.
