RikiNet: Reading Wikipedia Pages for Natural Question Answering | Dayiheng Liu | reading long documents to answer open-domain questions remains challenging in natural language understanding. in this paper , we introduce a new model , called rikinet , which reads wikipedia pages for natural question answering. rikinet contains a dynamic paragraph dual-attention reader and a multi-level cascaded answer predictor. the reader dynamically represents the document and question by utilizing a set of complementary attention mechanisms. the representations are then fed into the predictor to obtain the span of the short answer , the paragraph of the long answer , and the answer type in a cascaded manner. on the natural questions \( nq \) dataset , a single rikinet achieves 74.3 f1 and 57.9 f1 on long-answer and short-answer tasks. to our best knowledge , it is the first single model that outperforms the single human performance. furthermore , an ensemble rikinet obtains 76.1 f1 and 61.3 f1 on long-answer and short-answer tasks , achieving the best performance on the official nq leaderboard.
