Attend to Medical Ontologies: Content Selection for Clinical Abstractive Summarization | Sajad Sotudeh Gharebagh | sequence-to-sequence \( seq2seq \) network is a well-established model for text summarization task. it can learn to produce readable content; however , it falls short in effectively identifying key regions of the source. in this paper , we approach the content selection problem for clinical abstractive summarization by augmenting salient ontological terms into the summarizer. our experiments on two publicly available clinical data sets \( 107 , 372 reports of mimic-cxr , and 3 , 366 reports of openi \) show that our model statistically significantly boosts state-of-the-art results in terms of rouge metrics \( with improvements: 2.9% rg-1 , 2.5% rg-2 , 1.9% rg-l \) , in the healthcare domain where any range of improvement impacts patientsâ€™ welfare.
