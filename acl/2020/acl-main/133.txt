Fast and Accurate Non-Projective Dependency Tree Linearization | Xiang Yu | we propose a graph-based method to tackle the dependency tree linearization task. we formulate the task as a traveling salesman problem \( tsp \) , and use a biaffine attention model to calculate the edge costs. we facilitate the decoding by solving the tsp for each subtree and combining the solution into a projective tree. we then design a transition system as post-processing , inspired by non-projective transition-based parsing , to obtain non-projective sentences. our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art linearizer while being 10 times faster in training and decoding.
