SAS: Dialogue State Tracking via Slot Attention and Slot Information Sharing | Jiaying Hu | dialogue state tracker is responsible for inferring user intentions through dialogue history. previous methods have difficulties in handling dialogues with long interaction context , due to the excessive information. we propose a dialogue state tracker with slot attention and slot information sharing \( sas \) to reduce redundant informationâ€™s interference and improve long dialogue context tracking. specially , we first apply a slot attention to learn a set of slot-specific features from the original dialogue and then integrate them using a slot information sharing module. our model yields a significantly improved performance compared to previous state-of the-art models on the multiwoz dataset.
