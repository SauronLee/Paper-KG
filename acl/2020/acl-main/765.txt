Should All Cross-Lingual Embeddings Speak English? | Antonios Anastasopoulos | most of recent work in cross-lingual word embeddings is severely anglocentric. the vast majority of lexicon induction evaluation dictionaries are between english and another language , and the english embedding space is selected by default as the hub when learning in a multilingual setting. with this work , however , we challenge these practices. first , we show that the choice of hub language can significantly impact downstream lexicon induction zero-shot pos tagging performance. second , we both expand a standard english-centered evaluation dictionary collection to include all language pairs using triangulation , and create new dictionaries for under-represented languages. evaluating established methods over all these language pairs sheds light into their suitability for aligning embeddings from distant languages and presents new challenges for the field. finally , in our analysis we identify general guidelines for strong cross-lingual embedding baselines , that extend to language pairs that do not include english.
