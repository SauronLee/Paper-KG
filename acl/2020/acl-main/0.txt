Learning to Understand Child-directed and Adult-directed Speech | Lieke Gelderloos | speech directed to children differs from adult-directed speech in linguistic aspects such as repetition , word choice , and sentence length , as well as in aspects of the speech signal itself , such as prosodic and phonemic variation. human language acquisition research indicates that child-directed speech helps language learners. this study explores the effect of child-directed speech when learning to extract semantic information from speech directly. we compare the task performance of models trained on adult-directed speech \( ads \) and child-directed speech \( cds \) . we find indications that cds helps in the initial stages of learning , but eventually , models trained on ads reach comparable task performance , and generalize better. the results suggest that this is at least partially due to linguistic rather than acoustic properties of the two registers , as we see the same pattern when looking at models trained on acoustically comparable synthetic speech.
