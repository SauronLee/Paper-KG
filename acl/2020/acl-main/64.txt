Explicit Semantic Decomposition for Definition Generation | Jiahuan Li | definition generation , which aims to automatically generate dictionary definitions for words , has recently been proposed to assist the construction of dictionaries and help people understand unfamiliar texts. however , previous works hardly consider explicitly modeling the “components” of definitions , leading to under-specific generation results. in this paper , we propose esd , namely explicit semantic decomposition for definition generation , which explicitly decomposes the meaning of words into semantic components , and models them with discrete latent variables for definition generation. experimental results show that achieves top results on wordnet and oxford benchmarks , outperforming strong previous baselines.
