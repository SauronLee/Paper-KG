Contextualized Weak Supervision for Text Classification | Dheeraj Mekala | weakly supervised text classification based on a few user-provided seed words has recently attracted much attention from researchers. existing methods mainly generate pseudo-labels in a context-free manner \( e.g. , string matching \) , therefore , the ambiguous , context-dependent nature of human language has been long overlooked. in this paper , we propose a novel framework conwea , providing contextualized weak supervision for text classification. specifically , we leverage contextualized representations of word occurrences and seed word information to automatically differentiate multiple interpretations of the same word , and thus create a contextualized corpus. this contextualized corpus is further utilized to train the classifier and expand seed words in an iterative manner. this process not only adds new contextualized , highly label-indicative keywords but also disambiguates initial seed words , making our weak supervision fully contextualized. extensive experiments and case studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the necessity and significant advantages of using contextualized weak supervision , especially when the class labels are fine-grained.
