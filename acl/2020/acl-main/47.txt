GCAN: Graph-aware Co-Attention Networks for Explainable Fake News Detection on Social Media | Yi-Ju Lu | this paper solves the fake news detection problem under a more realistic scenario on social media. given the source short-text tweet and the corresponding sequence of retweet users without text comments , we aim at predicting whether the source tweet is fake or not , and generating explanation by highlighting the evidences on suspicious retweeters and the words they concern. we develop a novel neural network-based model , graph-aware co-attention networks \( gcan \) , to achieve the goal. extensive experiments conducted on real tweet datasets exhibit that gcan can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by 16% in accuracy on average. in addition , the case studies also show that gcan can produce reasonable explanations.
