A Frame-based Sentence Representation for Machine Reading Comprehension | Shaoru Guo | sentence representation \( sr \) is the most crucial and challenging task in machine reading comprehension \( mrc \) . mrc systems typically only utilize the information contained in the sentence itself , while human beings can leverage their semantic knowledge. to bridge the gap , we proposed a novel frame-based sentence representation \( fsr \) method , which employs frame semantic knowledge to facilitate sentence modelling. specifically , different from existing methods that only model lexical units \( lus \) , frame representation models , which utilize both lus in frame and frame-to-frame \( f-to-f \) relations , are designed to model frames and sentences with attention schema. our proposed fsr method is able to integrate multiple-frame semantic information to get much better sentence representations. our extensive experimental results show that it performs better than state-of-the-art technologies on machine reading comprehension task.
