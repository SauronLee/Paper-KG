Hierarchical Modeling for User Personality Prediction: The Role of Message-Level Attention | Veronica Lynn | not all documents are equally important. language processing is increasingly finding use as a supplement for questionnaires to assess psychological attributes of consenting individuals , but most approaches neglect to consider whether all documents of an individual are equally informative. in this paper , we present a novel model that uses message-level attention to learn the relative weight of usersâ€™ social media posts for assessing their five factor personality traits. we demonstrate that models with message-level attention outperform those with word-level attention , and ultimately yield state-of-the-art accuracies for all five traits by using both word and message attention in combination with past approaches \( an average increase in pearson r of 2.5% \) . in addition , examination of the high-signal posts identified by our model provides insight into the relationship between language and personality , helping to inform future work.
