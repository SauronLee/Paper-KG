Predicting Degrees of Technicality in Automatic Terminology Extraction | Anna HÃ¤tty | while automatic term extraction is a well-researched area , computational approaches to distinguish between degrees of technicality are still understudied. we semi-automatically create a german gold standard of technicality across four domains , and illustrate the impact of a web-crawled general-language corpus on technicality prediction. when defining a classification approach that combines general-language and domain-specific word embeddings , we go beyond previous work and align vector spaces to gain comparative embeddings. we suggest two novel models to exploit general- vs. domain-specific comparisons: a simple neural network model with pre-computed comparative-embedding information as input , and a multi-channel model computing the comparison internally. both models outperform previous approaches , with the multi-channel model performing best.
