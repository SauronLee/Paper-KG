CorefQA: Coreference Resolution as Query-based Span Prediction | Wei Wu | in this paper , we present corefqa , an accurate and extensible approach for the coreference resolution task. we formulate the problem as a span prediction task , like in question answering: a query is generated for each candidate mention using its surrounding context , and a span prediction module is employed to extract the text spans of the coreferences within the document using the generated query. this formulation comes with the following key advantages: \( 1 \) the span prediction strategy provides the flexibility of retrieving mentions left out at the mention proposal stage; \( 2 \) in the question answering framework , encoding the mention and its context explicitly in a query makes it possible to have a deep and thorough examination of cues embedded in the context of coreferent mentions; and \( 3 \) a plethora of existing question answering datasets can be used for data augmentation to improve the modelâ€™s generalization capability. experiments demonstrate significant performance boost over previous models , with 83.1 \( +3.5 \) f1 score on the conll-2012 benchmark and 87.5 \( +2.5 \) f1 score on the gap benchmark.
