Detecting Perceived Emotions in Hurricane Disasters | Shrey Desai | natural disasters \( e.g. , hurricanes \) affect millions of people each year , causing widespread destruction in their wake. people have recently taken to social media websites \( e.g. , twitter \) to share their sentiments and feelings with the larger community. consequently , these platforms have become instrumental in understanding and perceiving emotions at scale. in this paper , we introduce hurricaneemo , an emotion dataset of 15 , 000 english tweets spanning three hurricanes: harvey , irma , and maria. we present a comprehensive study of fine-grained emotions and propose classification tasks to discriminate between coarse-grained emotion groups. our best bert model , even after task-guided pre-training which leverages unlabeled twitter data , achieves only 68% accuracy \( averaged across all groups \) . hurricaneemo serves not only as a challenging benchmark for models but also as a valuable resource for analyzing emotions in disaster-centric domains.
