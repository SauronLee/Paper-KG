MixText: Linguistically-Informed Interpolation of Hidden Space for Semi-Supervised Text Classification | Jiaao Chen | this paper presents mixtext , a semi-supervised learning method for text classification , which uses our newly designed data augmentation method called tmix. tmix creates a large amount of augmented training samples by interpolating text in hidden space. moreover , we leverage recent advances in data augmentation to guess low-entropy labels for unlabeled data , hence making them as easy to use as labeled data. by mixing labeled , unlabeled and augmented data , mixtext significantly outperformed current pre-trained and fined-tuned models and other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods on several text classification benchmarks. the improvement is especially prominent when supervision is extremely limited. we have publicly released our code at https://github.com/gt-salt/mixtext.
