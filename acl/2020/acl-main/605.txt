Semantic Parsing for English as a Second Language | Yuanyuan Zhao | this paper is concerned with semantic parsing for english as a second language \( esl \) . motivated by the theoretical emphasis on the learning challenges that occur at the syntax-semantics interface during second language acquisition , we formulate the task based on the divergence between literal and intended meanings. we combine the complementary strengths of english resource grammar , a linguistically-precise hand-crafted deep grammar , and tle , an existing manually annotated esl ud-treebank with a novel reranking model. experiments demonstrate that in comparison to human annotations , our method can obtain a very promising sembanking quality. by means of the newly created corpus , we evaluate state-of-the-art semantic parsing as well as grammatical error correction models. the evaluation profiles the performance of neural nlp techniques for handling esl data and suggests some research directions.
