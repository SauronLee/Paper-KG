Tetra-Tagging: Word-Synchronous Parsing with Linear-Time Inference | Nikita Kitaev | we present a constituency parsing algorithm that , like a supertagger , works by assigning labels to each word in a sentence. in order to maximally leverage current neural architectures , the model scores each wordâ€™s tags in parallel , with minimal task-specific structure. after scoring , a left-to-right reconciliation phase extracts a tree in \( empirically \) linear time. our parser achieves 95.4 f1 on the wsj test set while also achieving substantial speedups compared to current state-of-the-art parsers with comparable accuracies.
