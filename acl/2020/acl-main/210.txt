Interactive Machine Comprehension with Information Seeking Agents | Xingdi Yuan | existing machine reading comprehension \( mrc \) models do not scale effectively to real-world applications like web-level information retrieval and question answering \( qa \) . we argue that this stems from the nature of mrc datasets: most of these are static environments wherein the supporting documents and all necessary information are fully observed. in this paper , we propose a simple method that reframes existing mrc datasets as interactive , partially observable environments. specifically , we “occlude” the majority of a document’s text and add context-sensitive commands that reveal “glimpses” of the hidden text to a model. we repurpose squad and newsqa as an initial case study , and then show how the interactive corpora can be used to train a model that seeks relevant information through sequential decision making. we believe that this setting can contribute in scaling models to web-level qa scenarios.
