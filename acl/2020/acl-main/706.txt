Iterative Edit-Based Unsupervised Sentence Simplification | Dhruv Kumar | we present a novel iterative , edit-based approach to unsupervised sentence simplification. our model is guided by a scoring function involving fluency , simplicity , and meaning preservation. then , we iteratively perform word and phrase-level edits on the complex sentence. compared with previous approaches , our model does not require a parallel training set , but is more controllable and interpretable. experiments on newsela and wikilarge datasets show that our approach is nearly as effective as state-of-the-art supervised approaches.
