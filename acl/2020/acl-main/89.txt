Learning to Identify Follow-Up Questions in Conversational Question Answering | Souvik Kundu | despite recent progress in conversational question answering , most prior work does not focus on follow-up questions. practical conversational question answering systems often receive follow-up questions in an ongoing conversation , and it is crucial for a system to be able to determine whether a question is a follow-up question of the current conversation , for more effective answer finding subsequently. in this paper , we introduce a new follow-up question identification task. we propose a three-way attentive pooling network that determines the suitability of a follow-up question by capturing pair-wise interactions between the associated passage , the conversation history , and a candidate follow-up question. it enables the model to capture topic continuity and topic shift while scoring a particular candidate follow-up question. experiments show that our proposed three-way attentive pooling network outperforms all baseline systems by significant margins.
