Fluent Response Generation for Conversational Question Answering | Ashutosh Baheti | question answering \( qa \) is an important aspect of open-domain conversational agents , garnering specific research focus in the conversational qa \( convqa \) subtask. one notable limitation of recent convqa efforts is the response being answer span extraction from the target corpus , thus ignoring the natural language generation \( nlg \) aspect of high-quality conversational agents. in this work , we propose a method for situating qa responses within a seq2seq nlg approach to generate fluent grammatical answer responses while maintaining correctness. from a technical perspective , we use data augmentation to generate training data for an end-to-end system. specifically , we develop syntactic transformations \( sts \) to produce question-specific candidate answer responses and rank them using a bert-based classifier \( devlin et al. , 2019 \) . human evaluation on squad 2.0 data \( rajpurkar et al. , 2018 \) demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline coqa and quac models in generating conversational responses. we further show our modelâ€™s scalability by conducting tests on the coqa dataset. the code and data are available at https://github.com/abaheti95/qadialogsystem.
