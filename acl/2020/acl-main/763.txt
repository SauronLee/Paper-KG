Predicting Performance for Natural Language Processing Tasks | Mengzhou Xia | given the complexity of combinations of tasks , languages , and domains in natural language processing \( nlp \) research , it is computationally prohibitive to exhaustively test newly proposed models on each possible experimental setting. in this work , we attempt to explore the possibility of gaining plausible judgments of how well an nlp model can perform under an experimental setting ,
