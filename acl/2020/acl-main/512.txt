OpinionDigest: A Simple Framework for Opinion Summarization | Yoshihiko Suhara | we present opiniondigest , an abstractive opinion summarization framework , which does not rely on gold-standard summaries for training. the framework uses an aspect-based sentiment analysis model to extract opinion phrases from reviews , and trains a transformer model to reconstruct the original reviews from these extractions. at summarization time , we merge extractions from multiple reviews and select the most popular ones. the selected opinions are used as input to the trained transformer model , which verbalizes them into an opinion summary. opiniondigest can also generate customized summaries , tailored to specific user needs , by filtering the selected opinions according to their aspect and/or sentiment. automatic evaluation on yelp data shows that our framework outperforms competitive baselines. human studies on two corpora verify that opiniondigest produces informative summaries and shows promising customization capabilities.
