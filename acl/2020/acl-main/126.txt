Conversational Word Embedding for Retrieval-Based Dialog System | Wentao Ma | human conversations contain many types of information , e.g. , knowledge , common sense , and language habits. in this paper , we propose a conversational word embedding method named pr-embedding , which utilizes the conversation pairs <post , reply> to learn word embedding. different from previous works , pr-embedding uses the vectors from two different semantic spaces to represent the words in post and reply.to catch the information among the pair , we first introduce the word alignment model from statistical machine translation to generate the cross-sentence window , then train the embedding on word-level and sentence-level.we evaluate the method on single-turn and multi-turn response selection tasks for retrieval-based dialog systems.the experiment results show that pr-embedding can improve the quality of the selected response.
