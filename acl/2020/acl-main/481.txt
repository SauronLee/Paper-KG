ZPR2: Joint Zero Pronoun Recovery and Resolution using Multi-Task Learning and BERT | Linfeng Song | zero pronoun recovery and resolution aim at recovering the dropped pronoun and pointing out its anaphoric mentions , respectively. we propose to better explore their interaction by solving both tasks together , while the previous work treats them separately. for zero pronoun resolution , we study this task in a more realistic setting , where no parsing trees or only automatic trees are available , while most previous work assumes gold trees. experiments on two benchmarks show that joint modeling significantly outperforms our baseline that already beats the previous state of the arts.
