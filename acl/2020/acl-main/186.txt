Speak to your Parser: Interactive Text-to-SQL with Natural Language Feedback | Ahmed Elgohary | we study the task of semantic parse correction with natural language feedback. given a natural language utterance , most semantic parsing systems pose the problem as one-shot translation where the utterance is mapped to a corresponding logical form. in this paper , we investigate a more interactive scenario where humans can further interact with the system by providing free-form natural language feedback to correct the system when it generates an inaccurate interpretation of an initial utterance. we focus on natural language to sql systems and construct , splash , a dataset of utterances , incorrect sql interpretations and the corresponding natural language feedback. we compare various reference models for the correction task and show that incorporating such a rich form of feedback can significantly improve the overall semantic parsing accuracy while retaining the flexibility of natural language interaction. while we estimated human correction accuracy is 81.5% , our best model achieves only 25.1% , which leaves a large gap for improvement in future research. splash is publicly available at https://aka.ms/splash_dataset.
