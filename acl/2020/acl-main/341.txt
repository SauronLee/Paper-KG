Transition-based Directed Graph Construction for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction | Chuang Fan | emotion-cause pair extraction aims to extract all potential pairs of emotions and corresponding causes from unannotated emotion text. most existing methods are pipelined framework , which identifies emotions and extracts causes separately , leading to a drawback of error propagation. towards this issue , we propose a transition-based model to transform the task into a procedure of parsing-like directed graph construction. the proposed model incrementally generates the directed graph with labeled edges based on a sequence of actions , from which we can recognize emotions with the corresponding causes simultaneously , thereby optimizing separate subtasks jointly and maximizing mutual benefits of tasks interdependently. experimental results show that our approach achieves the best performance , outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 6.71% \( p<0.01 \) in f1 measure.
