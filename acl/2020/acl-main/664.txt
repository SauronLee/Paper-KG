Shape of Synth to Come: Why We Should Use Synthetic Data for English Surface Realization | Henry Elder | the surface realization shared tasks of 2018 and 2019 were natural language generation shared tasks with the goal of exploring approaches to surface realization from universal-dependency-like trees to surface strings for several languages. in the 2018 shared task there was very little difference in the absolute performance of systems trained with and without additional , synthetically created data , and a new rule prohibiting the use of synthetic data was introduced for the 2019 shared task. contrary to the findings of the 2018 shared task , we show , in experiments on the english 2018 dataset , that the use of synthetic data can have a substantial positive effect â€“ an improvement of almost 8 bleu points for a previously state-of-the-art system. we analyse the effects of synthetic data , and we argue that its use should be encouraged rather than prohibited so that future research efforts continue to explore systems that can take advantage of such data.
