Unknown Intent Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Model with an Application to Zero-shot Intent Classification | Guangfeng Yan | user intent classification plays a vital role in dialogue systems. since user intent may frequently change over time in many realistic scenarios , unknown \( new \) intent detection has become an essential problem , where the study has just begun. this paper proposes a semantic-enhanced gaussian mixture model \( seg \) for unknown intent detection. in particular , we model utterance embeddings with a gaussian mixture distribution and inject dynamic class semantic information into gaussian means , which enables learning more class-concentrated embeddings that help to facilitate downstream outlier detection. coupled with a density-based outlier detection algorithm , seg achieves competitive results on three real task-oriented dialogue datasets in two languages for unknown intent detection. on top of that , we propose to integrate seg as an unknown intent identifier into existing generalized zero-shot intent classification models to improve their performance. a case study on a state-of-the-art method , recapsnet , shows that seg can push the classification performance to a significantly higher level.
