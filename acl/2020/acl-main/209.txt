INFOTABS: Inference on Tables as Semi-structured Data | Vivek Gupta | in this paper , we observe that semi-structured tabulated text is ubiquitous; understanding them requires not only comprehending the meaning of text fragments , but also implicit relationships between them. we argue that such data can prove as a testing ground for understanding how we reason about information. to study this , we introduce a new dataset called infotabs , comprising of human-written textual hypotheses based on premises that are tables extracted from wikipedia info-boxes. our analysis shows that the semi-structured , multi-domain and heterogeneous nature of the premises admits complex , multi-faceted reasoning. experiments reveal that , while human annotators agree on the relationships between a table-hypothesis pair , several standard modeling strategies are unsuccessful at the task , suggesting that reasoning about tables can pose a difficult modeling challenge.
