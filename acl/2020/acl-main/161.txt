You Don’t Have Time to Read This: An Exploration of Document Reading Time Prediction | Orion Weller | predicting reading time has been a subject of much previous work , focusing on how different words affect human processing , measured by reading time. however , previous work has dealt with a limited number of participants as well as word level only predictions \( i.e. predicting the time to read a single word \) . we seek to extend these works by examining whether or not document level predictions are effective , given additional information such as subject matter , font characteristics , and readability metrics. we perform a novel experiment to examine how different features of text contribute to the time it takes to read , distributing and collecting data from over a thousand participants. we then employ a large number of machine learning methods to predict a user’s reading time. we find that despite extensive research showing that word level reading time can be most effectively predicted by neural networks , larger scale text can be easily and most accurately predicted by one factor , the number of words.
