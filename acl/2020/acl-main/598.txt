Document Modeling with Graph Attention Networks for Multi-grained Machine Reading Comprehension | Bo Zheng | natural questions is a new challenging machine reading comprehension benchmark with two-grained answers , which are a long answer \( typically a paragraph \) and a short answer \( one or more entities inside the long answer \) . despite the effectiveness of existing methods on this benchmark , they treat these two sub-tasks individually during training while ignoring their dependencies. to address this issue , we present a novel multi-grained machine reading comprehension framework that focuses on modeling documents at their hierarchical nature , which are different levels of granularity: documents , paragraphs , sentences , and tokens. we utilize graph attention networks to obtain different levels of representations so that they can be learned simultaneously. the long and short answers can be extracted from paragraph-level representation and token-level representation , respectively. in this way , we can model the dependencies between the two-grained answers to provide evidence for each other. we jointly train the two sub-tasks , and our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous systems at both long and short answer criteria.
