Keyphrase Generation for Scientific Document Retrieval | Florian Boudin | sequence-to-sequence models have lead to significant progress in keyphrase generation , but it remains unknown whether they are reliable enough to be beneficial for document retrieval. this study provides empirical evidence that such models can significantly improve retrieval performance , and introduces a new extrinsic evaluation framework that allows for a better understanding of the limitations of keyphrase generation models. using this framework , we point out and discuss the difficulties encountered with supplementing documents with -not present in text- keyphrases , and generalizing models across domains. our code is available at https://github.com/boudinfl/ir-using-kg
