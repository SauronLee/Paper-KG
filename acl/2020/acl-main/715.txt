From English to Code-Switching: Transfer Learning with Strong Morphological Clues | Gustavo Aguilar | linguistic code-switching \( cs \) is still an understudied phenomenon in natural language processing. the nlp community has mostly focused on monolingual and multi-lingual scenarios , but little attention has been given to cs in particular. this is partly because of the lack of resources and annotated data , despite its increasing occurrence in social media platforms. in this paper , we aim at adapting monolingual models to code-switched text in various tasks. specifically , we transfer english knowledge from a pre-trained elmo model to different code-switched language pairs \( i.e. , nepali-english , spanish-english , and hindi-english \) using the task of language identification. our method , cs-elmo , is an extension of elmo with a simple yet effective position-aware attention mechanism inside its character convolutions. we show the effectiveness of this transfer learning step by outperforming multilingual bert and homologous cs-unaware elmo models and establishing a new state of the art in cs tasks , such as ner and pos tagging. our technique can be expanded to more english-paired code-switched languages , providing more resources to the cs community.
