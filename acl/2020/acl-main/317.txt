A Graph-based Coarse-to-fine Method for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction | Shuo Ren | unsupervised bilingual lexicon induction is the task of inducing word translations from monolingual corpora of two languages. recent methods are mostly based on unsupervised cross-lingual word embeddings , the key to which is to find initial solutions of word translations , followed by the learning and refinement of mappings between the embedding spaces of two languages. however , previous methods find initial solutions just based on word-level information , which may be \( 1 \) limited and inaccurate , and \( 2 \) prone to contain some noise introduced by the insufficiently pre-trained embeddings of some words. to deal with those issues , in this paper , we propose a novel graph-based paradigm to induce bilingual lexicons in a coarse-to-fine way. we first build a graph for each language with its vertices representing different words. then we extract word cliques from the graphs and map the cliques of two languages. based on that , we induce the initial word translation solution with the central words of the aligned cliques. this coarse-to-fine approach not only leverages clique-level information , which is richer and more accurate , but also effectively reduces the bad effect of the noise in the pre-trained embeddings. finally , we take the initial solution as the seed to learn cross-lingual embeddings , from which we induce bilingual lexicons. experiments show that our approach improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction compared with previous methods.
