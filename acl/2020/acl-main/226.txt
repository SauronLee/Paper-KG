Improving Adversarial Text Generation by Modeling the Distant Future | Ruiyi Zhang | auto-regressive text generation models usually focus on local fluency , and may cause inconsistent semantic meaning in long text generation. further , automatically generating words with similar semantics is challenging , and hand-crafted linguistic rules are difficult to apply. we consider a text planning scheme and present a model-based imitation-learning approach to alleviate the aforementioned issues. specifically , we propose a novel guider network to focus on the generative process over a longer horizon , which can assist next-word prediction and provide intermediate rewards for generator optimization. extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method leads to improved performance.
