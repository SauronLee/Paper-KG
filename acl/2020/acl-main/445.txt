More Diverse Dialogue Datasets via Diversity-Informed Data Collection | Katherine Stasaski | automated generation of conversational dialogue using modern neural architectures has made notable advances. however , these models are known to have a drawback of often producing uninteresting , predictable responses; this is known as the diversity problem. we introduce a new strategy to address this problem , called diversity-informed data collection. unlike prior approaches , which modify model architectures to solve the problem , this method uses dynamically computed corpus-level statistics to determine which conversational participants to collect data from. diversity-informed data collection produces significantly more diverse data than baseline data collection methods , and better results on two downstream tasks: emotion classification and dialogue generation. this method is generalizable and can be used with other corpus-level metrics.
