Analyzing analytical methods: The case of phonology in neural models of spoken language | Grzegorz Chrupa≈Ça | given the fast development of analysis techniques for nlp and speech processing systems , few systematic studies have been conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each method. as a step in this direction we study the case of representations of phonology in neural network models of spoken language. we use two commonly applied analytical techniques , diagnostic classifiers and representational similarity analysis , to quantify to what extent neural activation patterns encode phonemes and phoneme sequences. we manipulate two factors that can affect the outcome of analysis. first , we investigate the role of learning by comparing neural activations extracted from trained versus randomly-initialized models. second , we examine the temporal scope of the activations by probing both local activations corresponding to a few milliseconds of the speech signal , and global activations pooled over the whole utterance. we conclude that reporting analysis results with randomly initialized models is crucial , and that global-scope methods tend to yield more consistent and interpretable results and we recommend their use as a complement to local-scope diagnostic methods.
