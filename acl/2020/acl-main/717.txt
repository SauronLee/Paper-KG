Multi-Sentence Argument Linking | Seth Ebner | we present a novel document-level model for finding argument spans that fill an eventâ€™s roles , connecting related ideas in sentence-level semantic role labeling and coreference resolution. because existing datasets for cross-sentence linking are small , development of our neural model is supported through the creation of a new resource , roles across multiple sentences \( rams \) , which contains 9 , 124 annotated events across 139 types. we demonstrate strong performance of our model on rams and other event-related datasets.
