When do Word Embeddings Accurately Reflect Surveys on our Beliefs About People? | Kenneth Joseph | social biases are encoded in word embeddings. this presents a unique opportunity to study society historically and at scale , and a unique danger when embeddings are used in downstream applications. here , we investigate the extent to which publicly-available word embeddings accurately reflect beliefs about certain kinds of people as measured via traditional survey methods. we find that biases found in word embeddings do , on average , closely mirror survey data across seventeen dimensions of social meaning. however , we also find that biases in embeddings are much more reflective of survey data for some dimensions of meaning \( e.g. gender \) than others \( e.g. race \) , and that we can be highly confident that embedding-based measures reflect survey data only for the most salient biases.
