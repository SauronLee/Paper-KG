Predicting the Focus of Negation: Model and Error Analysis | Md Mosharaf Hossain | the focus of a negation is the set of tokens intended to be negated , and a key component for revealing affirmative alternatives to negated utterances. in this paper , we experiment with neural networks to predict the focus of negation. our main novelty is leveraging a scope detector to introduce the scope of negation as an additional input to the network. experimental results show that doing so obtains the best results to date. additionally , we perform a detailed error analysis providing insights into the main error categories , and analyze errors depending on whether the model takes into account scope and context information.
