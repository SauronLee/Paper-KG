Named Entity Recognition as Dependency Parsing | Juntao Yu | named entity recognition \( ner \) is a fundamental task in natural language processing , concerned with identifying spans of text expressing references to entities. ner research is often focused on flat entities only \( flat ner \) , ignoring the fact that entity references can be nested , as in [bank of [china]] \( finkel and manning , 2009 \) . in this paper , we use ideas from graph-based dependency parsing to provide our model a global view on the input via a biaffine model \( dozat and manning , 2017 \) . the biaffine model scores pairs of start and end tokens in a sentence which we use to explore all spans , so that the model is able to predict named entities accurately. we show that the model works well for both nested and flat ner through evaluation on 8 corpora and achieving sota performance on all of them , with accuracy gains of up to 2.2 percentage points.
