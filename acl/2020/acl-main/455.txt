Hooks in the Headline: Learning to Generate Headlines with Controlled Styles | Di Jin | current summarization systems only produce plain , factual headlines , far from the practical needs for the exposure and memorableness of the articles. we propose a new task , stylistic headline generation \( shg \) , to enrich the headlines with three style options \( humor , romance and clickbait \) , thus attracting more readers. with no style-specific article-headline pair \( only a standard headline summarization dataset and mono-style corpora \) , our method titlestylist generates stylistic headlines by combining the summarization and reconstruction tasks into a multitasking framework. we also introduced a novel parameter sharing scheme to further disentangle the style from text. through both automatic and human evaluation , we demonstrate that titlestylist can generate relevant , fluent headlines with three target styles: humor , romance , and clickbait. the attraction score of our model generated headlines outperforms the state-of-the-art summarization model by 9.68% , even outperforming human-written references.
