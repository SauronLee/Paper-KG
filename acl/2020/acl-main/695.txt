Supervised Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion of Orthographic Schwas in Hindi and Punjabi | Aryaman Arora | hindi grapheme-to-phoneme \( g2p \) conversion is mostly trivial , with one exception: whether a schwa represented in the orthography is pronounced or unpronounced \( deleted \) . previous work has attempted to predict schwa deletion in a rule-based fashion using prosodic or phonetic analysis. we present the first statistical schwa deletion classifier for hindi , which relies solely on the orthography as the input and outperforms previous approaches. we trained our model on a newly-compiled pronunciation lexicon extracted from various online dictionaries. our best hindi model achieves state of the art performance , and also achieves good performance on a closely related language , punjabi , without modification.
