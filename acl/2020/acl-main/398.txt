Target Inference in Argument Conclusion Generation | Milad Alshomary | in argumentation , people state premises to reason towards a conclusion. the conclusion conveys a stance towards some target , such as a concept or statement. often , the conclusion remains implicit , though , since it is self-evident in a discussion or left out for rhetorical reasons. however , the conclusion is key to understanding an argument and , hence , to any application that processes argumentation. we thus study the question to what extent an argument’s conclusion can be reconstructed from its premises. in particular , we argue here that a decisive step is to infer a conclusion’s target , and we hypothesize that this target is related to the premises’ targets. we develop two complementary target inference approaches: one ranks premise targets and selects the top-ranked target as the conclusion target , the other finds a new conclusion target in a learned embedding space using a triplet neural network. our evaluation on corpora from two domains indicates that a hybrid of both approaches is best , outperforming several strong baselines. according to human annotators , we infer a reasonably adequate conclusion target in 89% of the cases.
