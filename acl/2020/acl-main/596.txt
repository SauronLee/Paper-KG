Predicting Declension Class from Form and Meaning | Adina Williams | the noun lexica of many natural languages are divided into several declension classes with characteristic morphological properties. class membership is far from deterministic , but the phonological form of a noun and/or its meaning can often provide imperfect clues. here , we investigate the strength of those clues. more specifically , we operationalize this by measuring how much information , in bits , we can glean about declension class from knowing the form and/or meaning of nouns. we know that form and meaning are often also indicative of grammatical gender—which , as we quantitatively verify , can itself share information with declension class—so we also control for gender. we find for two indo-european languages \( czech and german \) that form and meaning respectively share significant amounts of information with class \( and contribute additional information above and beyond gender \) . the three-way interaction between class , form , and meaning \( given gender \) is also significant. our study is important for two reasons: first , we introduce a new method that provides additional quantitative support for a classic linguistic finding that form and meaning are relevant for the classification of nouns into declensions. secondly , we show not only that individual declensions classes vary in the strength of their clues within a language , but also that these variations themselves vary across languages.
