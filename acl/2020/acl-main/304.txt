Dynamic Online Conversation Recommendation | Xingshan Zeng | trending topics in social media content evolve over time , and it is therefore crucial to understand social media users and their interpersonal communications in a dynamic manner. here we study dynamic online conversation recommendation , to help users engage in conversations that satisfy their evolving interests. while most prior work assumes static user interests , our model is able to capture the temporal aspects of user interests , and further handle future conversations that are unseen during training time. concretely , we propose a neural architecture to exploit changes of user interactions and interests over time , to predict which discussions they are likely to enter. we conduct experiments on large-scale collections of reddit conversations , and results on three subreddits show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models that make a static assumption of user interests. we further evaluate on handling “cold start” , and observe consistently better performance by our model when considering various degrees of sparsity of user’s chatting history and conversation contexts. lastly , analyses on our model outputs indicate user interest change , explaining the advantage and efficacy of our approach.
