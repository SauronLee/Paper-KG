History for Visual Dialog: Do we really need it? | Shubham Agarwal | visual dialogue involves “understanding” the dialogue history \( what has been discussed previously \) and the current question \( what is asked \) , in addition to grounding information in the image , to accurately generate the correct response. in this paper , we show that co-attention models which explicitly encode dialoh history outperform models that don’t , achieving state-of-the-art performance \( 72 % ndcg on val set \) . however , we also expose shortcomings of the crowdsourcing dataset collection procedure , by showing that dialogue history is indeed only required for a small amount of the data , and that the current evaluation metric encourages generic replies. to that end , we propose a challenging subset \( visdialconv \) of the visdialval set and the benchmark ndcg of 63%.
