KinGDOM: Knowledge-Guided DOMain Adaptation for Sentiment Analysis | Deepanway Ghosal | cross-domain sentiment analysis has received significant attention in recent years , prompted by the need to combat the domain gap between different applications that make use of sentiment analysis. in this paper , we take a novel perspective on this task by exploring the role of external commonsense knowledge. we introduce a new framework , kingdom , which utilizes the conceptnet knowledge graph to enrich the semantics of a document by providing both domain-specific and domain-general background concepts. these concepts are learned by training a graph convolutional autoencoder that leverages inter-domain concepts in a domain-invariant manner. conditioning a popular domain-adversarial baseline method with these learned concepts helps improve its performance over state-of-the-art approaches , demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed framework.
