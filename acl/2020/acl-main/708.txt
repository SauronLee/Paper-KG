Neural CRF Model for Sentence Alignment in Text Simplification | Chao Jiang | the success of a text simplification system heavily depends on the quality and quantity of complex-simple sentence pairs in the training corpus , which are extracted by aligning sentences between parallel articles. to evaluate and improve sentence alignment quality , we create two manually annotated sentence-aligned datasets from two commonly used text simplification corpora , newsela and wikipedia. we propose a novel neural crf alignment model which not only leverages the sequential nature of sentences in parallel documents but also utilizes a neural sentence pair model to capture semantic similarity. experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all the previous work on monolingual sentence alignment task by more than 5 points in f1. we apply our crf aligner to construct two new text simplification datasets , newsela-auto and wiki-auto , which are much larger and of better quality compared to the existing datasets. a transformer-based seq2seq model trained on our datasets establishes a new state-of-the-art for text simplification in both automatic and human evaluation.
