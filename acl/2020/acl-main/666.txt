A Two-Step Approach for Implicit Event Argument Detection | Zhisong Zhang | in this work , we explore the implicit event argument detection task , which studies event arguments beyond sentence boundaries. the addition of cross-sentence argument candidates imposes great challenges for modeling. to reduce the number of candidates , we adopt a two-step approach , decomposing the problem into two sub-problems: argument head-word detection and head-to-span expansion. evaluated on the recent rams dataset \( ebner et al. , 2020 \) , our model achieves overall better performance than a strong sequence labeling baseline. we further provide detailed error analysis , presenting where the model mainly makes errors and indicating directions for future improvements. it remains a challenge to detect implicit arguments , calling for more future work of document-level modeling for this task.
