Hypernymy Detection for Low-Resource Languages via Meta Learning | Changlong Yu | hypernymy detection , a.k.a , lexical entailment , is a fundamental sub-task of many natural language understanding tasks. previous explorations mostly focus on monolingual hypernymy detection on high-resource languages , e.g. , english , but few investigate the low-resource scenarios. this paper addresses the problem of low-resource hypernymy detection by combining high-resource languages. we extensively compare three joint training paradigms and for the first time propose applying meta learning to relieve the low-resource issue. experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method among the three settings , which substantially improves the performance of extremely low-resource languages by preventing over-fitting on small datasets.
