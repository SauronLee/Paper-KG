Every Document Owns Its Structure: Inductive Text Classification via Graph Neural Networks | Yufeng Zhang | text classification is fundamental in natural language processing \( nlp \) and graph neural networks \( gnn \) are recently applied in this task. however , the existing graph-based works can neither capture the contextual word relationships within each document nor fulfil the inductive learning of new words. therefore in this work , to overcome such problems , we propose texting for inductive text classification via gnn. we first build individual graphs for each document and then use gnn to learn the fine-grained word representations based on their local structure , which can also effectively produce embeddings for unseen words in the new document. finally , the word nodes are aggregated as the document embedding. extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art text classification methods.
