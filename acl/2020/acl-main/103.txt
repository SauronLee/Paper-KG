Hierarchy-Aware Global Model for Hierarchical Text Classification | Jie Zhou | hierarchical text classification is an essential yet challenging subtask of multi-label text classification with a taxonomic hierarchy. existing methods have difficulties in modeling the hierarchical label structure in a global view. furthermore , they cannot make full use of the mutual interactions between the text feature space and the label space. in this paper , we formulate the hierarchy as a directed graph and introduce hierarchy-aware structure encoders for modeling label dependencies. based on the hierarchy encoder , we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchy-aware global model \( hiagm \) with two variants. a multi-label attention variant \( hiagm-la \) learns hierarchy-aware label embeddings through the hierarchy encoder and conducts inductive fusion of label-aware text features. a text feature propagation model \( hiagm-tp \) is proposed as the deductive variant that directly feeds text features into hierarchy encoders. compared with previous works , both hiagm-la and hiagm-tp achieve significant and consistent improvements on three benchmark datasets.
