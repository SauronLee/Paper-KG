Single-/Multi-Source Cross-Lingual NER via Teacher-Student Learning on Unlabeled Data in Target Language | Qianhui Wu | to better tackle the named entity recognition \( ner \) problem on languages with little/no labeled data , cross-lingual ner must effectively leverage knowledge learned from source languages with rich labeled data. previous works on cross-lingual ner are mostly based on label projection with pairwise texts or direct model transfer. however , such methods either are not applicable if the labeled data in the source languages is unavailable , or do not leverage information contained in unlabeled data in the target language. in this paper , we propose a teacher-student learning method to address such limitations , where ner models in the source languages are used as teachers to train a student model on unlabeled data in the target language. the proposed method works for both single-source and multi-source cross-lingual ner. for the latter , we further propose a similarity measuring method to better weight the supervision from different teacher models. extensive experiments for 3 target languages on benchmark datasets well demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for both single-source and multi-source cross-lingual ner.
