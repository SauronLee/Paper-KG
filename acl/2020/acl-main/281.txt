HyperCore: Hyperbolic and Co-graph Representation for Automatic ICD Coding | Pengfei Cao | the international classification of diseases \( icd \) provides a standardized way for classifying diseases , which endows each disease with a unique code. icd coding aims to assign proper icd codes to a medical record. since manual coding is very laborious and prone to errors , many methods have been proposed for the automatic icd coding task. however , most of existing methods independently predict each code , ignoring two important characteristics: code hierarchy and code co-occurrence. in this paper , we propose a hyperbolic and co-graph representation method \( hypercore \) to address the above problem. specifically , we propose a hyperbolic representation method to leverage the code hierarchy. moreover , we propose a graph convolutional network to utilize the code co-occurrence. experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
