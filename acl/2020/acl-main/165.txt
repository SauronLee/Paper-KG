Conversational Graph Grounded Policy Learning for Open-Domain Conversation Generation | Jun Xu | to address the challenge of policy learning in open-domain multi-turn conversation , we propose to represent prior information about dialog transitions as a graph and learn a graph grounded dialog policy , aimed at fostering a more coherent and controllable dialog. to this end , we first construct a conversational graph \( cg \) from dialog corpora , in which there are vertices to represent “what to say” and “how to say” , and edges to represent natural transition between a message \( the last utterance in a dialog context \) and its response. we then present a novel cg grounded policy learning framework that conducts dialog flow planning by graph traversal , which learns to identify a what-vertex and a how-vertex from the cg at each turn to guide response generation. in this way , we effectively leverage the cg to facilitate policy learning as follows: \( 1 \) it enables more effective long-term reward design , \( 2 \) it provides high-quality candidate actions , and \( 3 \) it gives us more control over the policy. results on two benchmark corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework.
