SKEP: Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training for Sentiment Analysis | Hao Tian | recently , sentiment analysis has seen remarkable advance with the help of pre-training approaches. however , sentiment knowledge , such as sentiment words and aspect-sentiment pairs , is ignored in the process of pre-training , despite the fact that they are widely used in traditional sentiment analysis approaches. in this paper , we introduce sentiment knowledge enhanced pre-training \( skep \) in order to learn a unified sentiment representation for multiple sentiment analysis tasks. with the help of automatically-mined knowledge , skep conducts sentiment masking and constructs three sentiment knowledge prediction objectives , so as to embed sentiment information at the word , polarity and aspect level into pre-trained sentiment representation. in particular , the prediction of aspect-sentiment pairs is converted into multi-label classification , aiming to capture the dependency between words in a pair. experiments on three kinds of sentiment tasks show that skep significantly outperforms strong pre-training baseline , and achieves new state-of-the-art results on most of the test datasets. we release our code at https://github.com/baidu/senta.
