Multi-Domain Named Entity Recognition with Genre-Aware and Agnostic Inference | Jing Wang | named entity recognition is a key component of many text processing pipelines and it is thus essential for this component to be robust to different types of input. however , domain transfer of ner models with data from multiple genres has not been widely studied. to this end , we conduct ner experiments in three predictive setups on data from: a \) multiple domains; b \) multiple domains where the genre label is unknown at inference time; c \) domains not encountered in training. we introduce a new architecture tailored to this task by using shared and private domain parameters and multi-task learning. this consistently outperforms all other baseline and competitive methods on all three experimental setups , with differences ranging between +1.95 to +3.11 average f1 across multiple genres when compared to standard approaches. these results illustrate the challenges that need to be taken into account when building real-world nlp applications that are robust to various types of text and the methods that can help , at least partially , alleviate these issues.
