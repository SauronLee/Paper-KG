Efficient Pairwise Annotation of Argument Quality | Lukas Gienapp | we present an efficient annotation framework for argument quality , a feature difficult to be measured reliably as per previous work. a stochastic transitivity model is combined with an effective sampling strategy to infer high-quality labels with low effort from crowdsourced pairwise judgments. the modelâ€™s capabilities are showcased by compiling webis-argquality-20 , an argument quality corpus that comprises scores for rhetorical , logical , dialectical , and overall quality inferred from a total of 41 , 859 pairwise judgments among 1 , 271 arguments. with up to 93% cost savings , our approach significantly outperforms existing annotation procedures. furthermore , novel insight into argument quality is provided through statistical analysis , and a new aggregation method to infer overall quality from individual quality dimensions is proposed.
