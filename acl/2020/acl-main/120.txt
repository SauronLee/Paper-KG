Attend, Translate and Summarize: An Efficient Method for Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization | Junnan Zhu | cross-lingual summarization aims at summarizing a document in one language \( e.g. , chinese \) into another language \( e.g. , english \) . in this paper , we propose a novel method inspired by the translation pattern in the process of obtaining a cross-lingual summary. we first attend to some words in the source text , then translate them into the target language , and summarize to get the final summary. specifically , we first employ the encoder-decoder attention distribution to attend to the source words. second , we present three strategies to acquire the translation probability , which helps obtain the translation candidates for each source word. finally , each summary word is generated either from the neural distribution or from the translation candidates of source words. experimental results on chinese-to-english and english-to-chinese summarization tasks have shown that our proposed method can significantly outperform the baselines , achieving comparable performance with the state-of-the-art.
