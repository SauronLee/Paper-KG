Hiring Now: A Skill-Aware Multi-Attention Model for Job Posting Generation | Liting Liu | writing a good job posting is a critical step in the recruiting process , but the task is often more difficult than many people think. it is challenging to specify the level of education , experience , relevant skills per the company information and job description. to this end , we propose a novel task of job posting generation \( jpg \) which is cast as a conditional text generation problem to generate job requirements according to the job descriptions. to deal with this task , we devise a data-driven global skill-aware multi-attention generation model , named sama. specifically , to model the complex mapping relationships between input and output , we design a hierarchical decoder that we first label the job description with multiple skills , then we generate a complete text guided by the skill labels. at the same time , to exploit the prior knowledge about the skills , we further construct a skill knowledge graph to capture the global prior knowledge of skills and refine the generated results. the proposed approach is evaluated on real-world job posting data. experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
