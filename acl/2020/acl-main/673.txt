Understanding Advertisements with BERT | Kanika Kalra | we consider a task based on cvpr 2018 challenge dataset on advertisement \( ad \) understanding. the task involves detecting the viewerâ€™s interpretation of an ad image captured as text. recent results have shown that the embedded scene-text in the image holds a vital cue for this task. motivated by this , we fine-tune the base bert model for a sentence-pair classification task. despite utilizing the scene-text as the only source of visual information , we could achieve a hit-or-miss accuracy of 84.95% on the challenge test data. to enable bert to process other visual information , we append image captions to the scene-text. this achieves an accuracy of 89.69% , which is an improvement of 4.7%. this is the best reported result for this task.
