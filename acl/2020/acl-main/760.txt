DeSePtion: Dual Sequence Prediction and Adversarial Examples for Improved Fact-Checking | Christopher Hidey | the increased focus on misinformation has spurred development of data and systems for detecting the veracity of a claim as well as retrieving authoritative evidence. the fact extraction and verification \( fever \) dataset provides such a resource for evaluating endto- end fact-checking , requiring retrieval of evidence from wikipedia to validate a veracity prediction. we show that current systems for fever are vulnerable to three categories of realistic challenges for fact-checking – multiple propositions , temporal reasoning , and ambiguity and lexical variation – and introduce a resource with these types of claims. then we present a system designed to be resilient to these “attacks” using multiple pointer networks for document selection and jointly modeling a sequence of evidence sentences and veracity relation predictions. we find that in handling these attacks we obtain state-of-the-art results on fever , largely due to improved evidence retrieval.
