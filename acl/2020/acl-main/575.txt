MIE: A Medical Information Extractor towards Medical Dialogues | Yuanzhe Zhang | electronic medical records \( emrs \) have become key components of modern medical care systems. despite the merits of emrs , many doctors suffer from writing them , which is time-consuming and tedious. we believe that automatically converting medical dialogues to emrs can greatly reduce the burdens of doctors , and extracting information from medical dialogues is an essential step. to this end , we annotate online medical consultation dialogues in a window-sliding style , which is much easier than the sequential labeling annotation. we then propose a medical information extractor \( mie \) towards medical dialogues. mie is able to extract mentioned symptoms , surgeries , tests , other information and their corresponding status. to tackle the particular challenges of the task , mie uses a deep matching architecture , taking dialogue turn-interaction into account. the experimental results demonstrate mie is a promising solution to extract medical information from doctor-patient dialogues.
