Unsupervised Paraphrasing by Simulated Annealing | Xianggen Liu | we propose upsa , a novel approach that accomplishes unsupervised paraphrasing by simulated annealing. we model paraphrase generation as an optimization problem and propose a sophisticated objective function , involving semantic similarity , expression diversity , and language fluency of paraphrases. upsa searches the sentence space towards this objective by performing a sequence of local editing. we evaluate our approach on various datasets , namely , quora , wikianswers , mscoco , and twitter. extensive results show that upsa achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with previous unsupervised methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluations. further , our approach outperforms most existing domain-adapted supervised models , showing the generalizability of upsa.
