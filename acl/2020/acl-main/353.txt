Learning Implicit Text Generation via Feature Matching | Inkit Padhi | generative feature matching network \( gfmn \) is an approach for training state-of-the-art implicit generative models for images by performing moment matching on features from pre-trained neural networks. in this paper , we present new gfmn formulations that are effective for sequential data. our experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method , seqgfmn , for three distinct generation tasks in english: unconditional text generation , class-conditional text generation , and unsupervised text style transfer. seqgfmn is stable to train and outperforms various adversarial approaches for text generation and text style transfer.
