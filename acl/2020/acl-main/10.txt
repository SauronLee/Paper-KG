Span-ConveRT: Few-shot Span Extraction for Dialog with Pretrained Conversational Representations | Samuel Coope | we introduce span-convert , a light-weight model for dialog slot-filling which frames the task as a turn-based span extraction task. this formulation allows for a simple integration of conversational knowledge coded in large pretrained conversational models such as convert \( henderson et al. , 2019 \) . we show that leveraging such knowledge in span-convert is especially useful for few-shot learning scenarios: we report consistent gains over 1 \) a span extractor that trains representations from scratch in the target domain , and 2 \) a bert-based span extractor. in order to inspire more work on span extraction for the slot-filling task , we also release restaurants-8k , a new challenging data set of 8 , 198 utterances , compiled from actual conversations in the restaurant booking domain.
