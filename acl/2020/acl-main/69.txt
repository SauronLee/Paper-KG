An Online Semantic-enhanced Dirichlet Model for Short Text Stream Clustering | Jay Kumar | clustering short text streams is a challenging task due to its unique properties: infinite length , sparse data representation and cluster evolution. existing approaches often exploit short text streams in a batch way. however , determine the optimal batch size is usually a difficult task since we have no priori knowledge when the topics evolve. in addition , traditional independent word representation in graphical model tends to cause “term ambiguity” problem in short text clustering. therefore , in this paper , we propose an online semantic-enhanced dirichlet model for short sext stream clustering , called osdm , which integrates the word-occurance semantic information \( i.e. , context \) into a new graphical model and clusters each arriving short text automatically in an online way. extensive results have demonstrated that osdm has better performance compared to many state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data sets.
