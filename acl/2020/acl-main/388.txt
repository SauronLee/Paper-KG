Modeling Word Formation in Englishâ€“German Neural Machine Translation | Marion Weller-Di Marco | this paper studies strategies to model word formation in nmt using rich linguistic information , namely a word segmentation approach that goes beyond splitting into substrings by considering fusional morphology. our linguistically sound segmentation is combined with a method for target-side inflection to accommodate modeling word formation. the best system variants employ source-side morphological analysis and model complex target-side words , improving over a standard system.
