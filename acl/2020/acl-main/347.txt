Meta-Transfer Learning for Code-Switched Speech Recognition | Genta Indra Winata | an increasing number of people in the world today speak a mixed-language as a result of being multilingual. however , building a speech recognition system for code-switching remains difficult due to the availability of limited resources and the expense and significant effort required to collect mixed-language data. we therefore propose a new learning method , meta-transfer learning , to transfer learn on a code-switched speech recognition system in a low-resource setting by judiciously extracting information from high-resource monolingual datasets. our model learns to recognize individual languages , and transfer them so as to better recognize mixed-language speech by conditioning the optimization on the code-switching data. based on experimental results , our model outperforms existing baselines on speech recognition and language modeling tasks , and is faster to converge.
