Cross-Lingual Semantic Role Labeling with High-Quality Translated Training Corpus | Hao Fei | many efforts of research are devoted to semantic role labeling \( srl \) which is crucial for natural language understanding. supervised approaches have achieved impressing performances when large-scale corpora are available for resource-rich languages such as english. while for the low-resource languages with no annotated srl dataset , it is still challenging to obtain competitive performances. cross-lingual srl is one promising way to address the problem , which has achieved great advances with the help of model transferring and annotation projection. in this paper , we propose a novel alternative based on corpus translation , constructing high-quality training datasets for the target languages from the source gold-standard srl annotations. experimental results on universal proposition bank show that the translation-based method is highly effective , and the automatic pseudo datasets can improve the target-language srl performances significantly.
