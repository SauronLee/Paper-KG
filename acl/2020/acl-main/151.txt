Parallel Sentence Mining by Constrained Decoding | Pinzhen Chen | we present a novel method to extract parallel sentences from two monolingual corpora , using neural machine translation. our method relies on translating sentences in one corpus , but constraining the decoding by a prefix tree built on the other corpus. we argue that a neural machine translation system by itself can be a sentence similarity scorer and it efficiently approximates pairwise comparison with a modified beam search. when benchmarked on the bucc shared task , our method achieves results comparable to other submissions.
