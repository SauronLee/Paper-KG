On the Importance of Diversity in Question Generation for QA | Md Arafat Sultan | automatic question generation \( qg \) has shown promise as a source of synthetic training data for question answering \( qa \) . in this paper we ask: is textual diversity in qg beneficial for downstream qa \? using top-p nucleus sampling to derive samples from a transformer-based question generator , we show that diversity-promoting qg indeed provides better qa training than likelihood maximization approaches such as beam search. we also show that standard qg evaluation metrics such as bleu , rouge and meteor are inversely correlated with diversity , and propose a diversity-aware intrinsic measure of overall qg quality that correlates well with extrinsic evaluation on qa.
