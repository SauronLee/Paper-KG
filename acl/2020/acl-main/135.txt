A Novel Cascade Binary Tagging Framework for Relational Triple Extraction | Zhepei Wei | extracting relational triples from unstructured text is crucial for large-scale knowledge graph construction. however , few existing works excel in solving the overlapping triple problem where multiple relational triples in the same sentence share the same entities. in this work , we introduce a fresh perspective to revisit the relational triple extraction task and propose a novel cascade binary tagging framework \( casrel \) derived from a principled problem formulation. instead of treating relations as discrete labels as in previous works , our new framework models relations as functions that map subjects to objects in a sentence , which naturally handles the overlapping problem. experiments show that the casrel framework already outperforms state-of-the-art methods even when its encoder module uses a randomly initialized bert encoder , showing the power of the new tagging framework. it enjoys further performance boost when employing a pre-trained bert encoder , outperforming the strongest baseline by 17.5 and 30.2 absolute gain in f1-score on two public datasets nyt and webnlg , respectively. in-depth analysis on different scenarios of overlapping triples shows that the method delivers consistent performance gain across all these scenarios. the source code and data are released online.
