“Who said it, and Why?” Provenance for Natural Language Claims | Yi Zhang | in an era where generating content and publishing it is so easy , we are bombarded with information and are exposed to all kinds of claims , some of which do not always rank high on the truth scale. this paper suggests that the key to a longer-term , holistic , and systematic approach to navigating this information pollution is capturing the provenance of claims. to do that , we develop a formal definition of provenance graph for a given natural language claim , aiming to understand where the claim may come from and how it has evolved. to construct the graph , we model provenance inference , formulated mainly as an information extraction task and addressed via a textual entailment model. we evaluate our approach using two benchmark datasets , showing initial success in capturing the notion of provenance and its effectiveness on the application of claim verification.
