An Empirical Comparison of Unsupervised Constituency Parsing Methods | Jun Li | unsupervised constituency parsing aims to learn a constituency parser from a training corpus without parse tree annotations. while many methods have been proposed to tackle the problem , including statistical and neural methods , their experimental results are often not directly comparable due to discrepancies in datasets , data preprocessing , lexicalization , and evaluation metrics. in this paper , we first examine experimental settings used in previous work and propose to standardize the settings for better comparability between methods. we then empirically compare several existing methods , including decade-old and newly proposed ones , under the standardized settings on english and japanese , two languages with different branching tendencies. we find that recent models do not show a clear advantage over decade-old models in our experiments. we hope our work can provide new insights into existing methods and facilitate future empirical evaluation of unsupervised constituency parsing.
