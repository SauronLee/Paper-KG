Enhancing Cross-target Stance Detection with Transferable Semantic-Emotion Knowledge | Bowen Zhang | stance detection is an important task , which aims to classify the attitude of an opinionated text towards a given target. remarkable success has been achieved when sufficient labeled training data is available. however , annotating sufficient data is labor-intensive , which establishes significant barriers for generalizing the stance classifier to the data with new targets. in this paper , we proposed a semantic-emotion knowledge transferring \( sekt \) model for cross-target stance detection , which uses the external knowledge \( semantic and emotion lexicons \) as a bridge to enable knowledge transfer across different targets. specifically , a semantic-emotion heterogeneous graph is constructed from external semantic and emotion lexicons , which is then fed into a graph convolutional network to learn multi-hop semantic connections between words and emotion tags. then , the learned semantic-emotion graph representation , which serves as prior knowledge bridging the gap between the source and target domains , is fully integrated into the bidirectional long short-term memory \( bilstm \) stance classifier by adding a novel knowledge-aware memory unit to the bilstm cell. extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of sekt against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.
