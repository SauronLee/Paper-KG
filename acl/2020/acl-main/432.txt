On the Spontaneous Emergence of Discrete and Compositional Signals | Nur Geffen Lan | we propose a general framework to study language emergence through signaling games with neural agents. using a continuous latent space , we are able to \( i \) train using backpropagation , \( ii \) show that discrete messages nonetheless naturally emerge. we explore whether categorical perception effects follow and show that the messages are not compositional.
