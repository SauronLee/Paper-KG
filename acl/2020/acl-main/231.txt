Learning to execute instructions in a Minecraft dialogue | Prashant Jayannavar | the minecraft collaborative building task is a two-player game in which an architect \( a \) instructs a builder \( b \) to construct a target structure in a simulated blocks world environment. we define the subtask of predicting correct action sequences \( block placements and removals \) in a given game context , and show that capturing b’s past actions as well as b’s perspective leads to a significant improvement in performance on this challenging language understanding problem.
