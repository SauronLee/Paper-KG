Tree-Structured Neural Topic Model | Masaru Isonuma | this paper presents a tree-structured neural topic model , which has a topic distribution over a tree with an infinite number of branches. our model parameterizes an unbounded ancestral and fraternal topic distribution by applying doubly-recurrent neural networks. with the help of autoencoding variational bayes , our model improves data scalability and achieves competitive performance when inducing latent topics and tree structures , as compared to a prior tree-structured topic model \( blei et al. , 2010 \) . this work extends the tree-structured topic model such that it can be incorporated with neural models for downstream tasks.
