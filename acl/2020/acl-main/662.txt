What are the Goals of Distributional Semantics? | Guy Emerson | distributional semantic models have become a mainstay in nlp , providing useful features for downstream tasks. however , assessing long-term progress requires explicit long-term goals. in this paper , i take a broad linguistic perspective , looking at how well current models can deal with various semantic challenges. given stark differences between models proposed in different subfields , a broad perspective is needed to see how we could integrate them. i conclude that , while linguistic insights can guide the design of model architectures , future progress will require balancing the often conflicting demands of linguistic expressiveness and computational tractability.
