Improving Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition using Joint Sentence and Token Labeling | Canasai Kruengkrai | exploiting sentence-level labels , which are easy to obtain , is one of the plausible methods to improve low-resource named entity recognition \( ner \) , where token-level labels are costly to annotate. current models for jointly learning sentence and token labeling are limited to binary classification. we present a joint model that supports multi-class classification and introduce a simple variant of self-attention that allows the model to learn scaling factors. our model produces 3.78% , 4.20% , 2.08% improvements in f1 over the bilstm-crf baseline on e-commerce product titles in three different low-resource languages: vietnamese , thai , and indonesian , respectively.
