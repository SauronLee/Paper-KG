Dynamic Memory Induction Networks for Few-Shot Text Classification | Ruiying Geng | this paper proposes dynamic memory induction networks \( dmin \) for few-short text classification. the model develops a dynamic routing mechanism over static memory , enabling it to better adapt to unseen classes , a critical capability for few-short classification. the model also expands the induction process with supervised learning weights and query information to enhance the generalization ability of meta-learning. the proposed model brings forward the state-of-the-art performance significantly by 2~4% improvement on the minircv1 and odic datasets. detailed analysis is further performed to show how the proposed network achieves the new performance.
