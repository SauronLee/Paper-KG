ZeroShotCeres: Zero-Shot Relation Extraction from Semi-Structured Webpages | Colin Lockard | in many documents , such as semi-structured webpages , textual semantics are augmented with additional information conveyed using visual elements including layout , font size , and color. prior work on information extraction from semi-structured websites has required learning an extraction model specific to a given template via either manually labeled or distantly supervised data from that template. in this work , we propose a solution for “zero-shot” open-domain relation extraction from webpages with a previously unseen template , including from websites with little overlap with existing sources of knowledge for distant supervision and websites in entirely new subject verticals. our model uses a graph neural network-based approach to build a rich representation of text fields on a webpage and the relationships between them , enabling generalization to new templates. experiments show this approach provides a 31% f1 gain over a baseline for zero-shot extraction in a new subject vertical.
