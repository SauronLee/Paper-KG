Fatality Killed the Cat or: BabelPic, a Multimodal Dataset for Non-Concrete Concepts | Agostina Calabrese | thanks to the wealth of high-quality annotated images available in popular repositories such as imagenet , multimodal language-vision research is in full bloom. however , events , feelings and many other kinds of concepts which can be visually grounded are not well represented in current datasets. nevertheless , we would expect a wide-coverage language understanding system to be able to classify images depicting recess and remorse , not just cats , dogs and bridges. we fill this gap by presenting babelpic , a hand-labeled dataset built by cleaning the image-synset association found within the babelnet lexical knowledge base \( lkb \) . babelpic explicitly targets non-concrete concepts , thus providing refreshing new data for the community. we also show that pre-trained language-vision systems can be used to further expand the resource by exploiting natural language knowledge available in the lkb. babelpic is available for download at http://babelpic.org.
