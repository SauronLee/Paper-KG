A Two-Stage Masked LM Method for Term Set Expansion | Guy Kushilevitz | we tackle the task of term set expansion \( tse \) : given a small seed set of example terms from a semantic class , finding more members of that class. the task is of great practical utility , and also of theoretical utility as it requires generalization from few examples. previous approaches to the tse task can be characterized as either distributional or pattern-based. we harness the power of neural masked language models \( mlm \) and propose a novel tse algorithm , which combines the pattern-based and distributional approaches. due to the small size of the seed set , fine-tuning methods are not effective , calling for more creative use of the mlm. the gist of the idea is to use the mlm to first mine for informative patterns with respect to the seed set , and then to obtain more members of the seed class by generalizing these patterns. our method outperforms state-of-the-art tse algorithms. implementation is available at: https://github.com/ guykush/termsetexpansion-mpb/
