Annotating and quantifying narrative time disruptions in modernist and hypertext fiction | Edward Kearns | this paper outlines work in progress on a new method of annotating and quantitatively discussing narrative techniques related to time in fiction. specifically those techniques are analepsis , prolepsis , narrative level changes , and stream-of-consciousness and free-indirect-discourse narration. by counting the frequency and extent of the usage of these techniques , the narrative characteristics of different works from different time periods and genres can be compared. this project uses modernist fiction and hypertext fiction as its case studies.
