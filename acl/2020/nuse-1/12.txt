Frustratingly Hard Evidence Retrieval for QA Over Books | Xiangyang Mou | a lot of progress has been made to improve question answering \( qa \) in recent years , but the special problem of qa over narrative book stories has not been explored in-depth. we formulate bookqa as an open-domain qa task given its similar dependency on evidence retrieval. we further investigate how state-of-the-art open-domain qa approaches can help bookqa. besides achieving state-of-the-art on the narrativeqa benchmark , our study also reveals the difficulty of evidence retrieval in books with a wealth of experiments and analysis - which necessitates future effort on novel solutions for evidence retrieval in bookqa.
