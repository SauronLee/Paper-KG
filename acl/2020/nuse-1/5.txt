Exploring the Effect of Author and Reader Identity in Online Story Writing: the STORIESINTHEWILD Corpus. | Tal August | current story writing or story editing systems rely on human judgments of story quality for evaluating performance , often ignoring the subjectivity in ratings. we analyze the effect of author and reader characteristics and story writing setup on the quality of stories in a short storytelling task. to study this effect , we create and release storiesinthewild , containing 1 , 630 stories collected on a volunteer-based crowdsourcing platform. each story is rated by three different readers , and comes paired with the author’s and reader’s age , gender , and personality. our findings show significant effects of authors’ and readers’ identities , as well as writing setup , on story writing and ratings. notably , compared to younger readers , readers age 45 and older consider stories significantly less creative and less entertaining. readers also prefer stories written all at once , rather than in chunks , finding them more coherent and creative. we also observe linguistic differences associated with authors’ demographics \( e.g. , older authors wrote more vivid and emotional stories \) . our findings suggest that reader and writer demographics , as well as writing setup , should be accounted for in story writing evaluations.
