Exploring aspects of similarity between spoken personal narratives by disentangling them into narrative clause types | Belen Saldias | sharing personal narratives is a fundamental aspect of human social behavior as it helps share our life experiences. we can tell stories and rely on our background to understand their context , similarities , and differences. a substantial effort has been made towards developing storytelling machines or inferring characters’ features. however , we don’t usually find models that compare narratives. this task is remarkably challenging for machines since they , as sometimes we do , lack an understanding of what similarity means. to address this challenge , we first introduce a corpus of real-world spoken personal narratives comprising 10 , 296 narrative clauses from 594 video transcripts. second , we ask non-narrative experts to annotate those clauses under labov’s sociolinguistic model of personal narratives \( i.e. , action , orientation , and evaluation clause types \) and train a classifier that reaches 84.7% f-score for the highest-agreed clauses. finally , we match stories and explore whether people implicitly rely on labov’s framework to compare narratives. we show that actions followed by the narrator’s evaluation of these are the aspects non-experts consider the most. our approach is intended to help inform machine learning methods aimed at studying or representing personal narratives.
