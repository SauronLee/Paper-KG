Screenplay Quality Assessment: Can We Predict Who Gets Nominated? | Ming-Chang Chiu | deciding which scripts to turn into movies is a costly and time-consuming process for filmmakers. thus , building a tool to aid script selection , an initial phase in movie production , can be very beneficial. toward that goal , in this work , we present a method to evaluate the quality of a screenplay based on linguistic cues. we address this in a two-fold approach: \( 1 \) we define the task as predicting nominations of scripts at major film awards with the hypothesis that the peer-recognized scripts should have a greater chance to succeed. \( 2 \) based on industry opinions and narratology , we extract and integrate domain-specific features into common classification techniques. we face two challenges \( 1 \) scripts are much longer than other document datasets \( 2 \) nominated scripts are limited and thus difficult to collect. however , with narratology-inspired modeling and domain features , our approach offers clear improvements over strong baselines. our work provides a new approach for future work in screenplay analysis.
