Systematic Evaluation of a Framework for Unsupervised Emotion Recognition for Narrative Text | Samira Zad | identifying emotions as expressed in text \( a.k.a. text emotion recognition \) has received a lot of attention over the past decade. narratives often involve a great deal of emotional expression , and so emotion recognition on narrative text is of great interest to computational approaches to narrative understanding. prior work by kim et al. 2010 was the work with the highest reported emotion detection performance , on a corpus of fairy tales texts. close inspection of that work , however , revealed significant reproducibility problems , and we were unable to reimplement kim’s approach as described. as a consequence , we implemented a framework inspired by kim’s approach , where we carefully evaluated the major design choices. we identify the highest-performing combination , which outperforms kim’s reported performance by 7.6
