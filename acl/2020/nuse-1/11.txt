Emotion Arcs of Student Narratives | Swapna Somasundaran | this paper studies emotion arcs in student narratives. we construct emotion arcs based on event affect and implied sentiments , which correspond to plot elements in the story. we show that student narratives can show elements of plot structure in their emotion arcs and that properties of these arcs can be useful indicators of narrative quality. we build a system and perform analysis to show that our arc-based features are complementary to previously studied sentiment features in this area.
