Detecting and understanding moral biases in news | Usman Shahid | we describe work in progress on detecting and understanding the moral biases of news sources by combining framing theory with natural language processing. first we draw connections between issue-specific frames and moral frames that apply to all issues. then we analyze the connection between moral frame presence and news source political leaning. we develop and test a simple classification model for detecting the presence of a moral frame , highlighting the need for more sophisticated models. we also discuss some of the annotation and frame detection challenges that can inform future research in this area.
