Start-Before-End and End-to-End: Neural Speech Translation by AppTek and RWTH Aachen University | Parnia Bahar | apptek and rwth aachen university team together to participate in the offline and simultaneous speech translation tracks of iwslt 2020. for the offline task , we create both cascaded and end-to-end speech translation systems , paying attention to careful data selection and weighting. in the cascaded approach , we combine high-quality hybrid automatic speech recognition \( asr \) with the transformer-based neural machine translation \( nmt \) . our end-to-end direct speech translation systems benefit from pretraining of adapted encoder and decoder components , as well as synthetic data and fine-tuning and thus are able to compete with cascaded systems in terms of mt quality. for simultaneous translation , we utilize a novel architecture that makes dynamic decisions , learned from parallel data , to determine when to continue feeding on input or generate output words. experiments with speech and text input show that even at low latency this architecture leads to superior translation results.
