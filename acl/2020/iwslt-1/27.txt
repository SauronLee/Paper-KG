Towards Stream Translation: Adaptive Computation Time for Simultaneous Machine Translation | Felix Schneider | simultaneous machine translation systems rely on a policy to schedule read and write operations in order to begin translating a source sentence before it is complete. in this paper , we demonstrate the use of adaptive computation time \( act \) as an adaptive , learned policy for simultaneous machine translation using the transformer model and as a more numerically stable alternative to monotonic infinite lookback attention \( milk \) . we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of latency-quality tradeoffs. we also propose a method to use our model on unsegmented input , i.e. without sentence boundaries , simulating the condition of translating output from automatic speech recognition. we present first benchmark results on this task.
