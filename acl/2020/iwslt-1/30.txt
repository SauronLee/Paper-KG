From Speech-to-Speech Translation to Automatic Dubbing | Marcello Federico | we present enhancements to a speech-to-speech translation pipeline in order to perform automatic dubbing. our architecture features neural machine translation generating output of preferred length , prosodic alignment of the translation with the original speech segments , neural text-to-speech with fine tuning of the duration of each utterance , and , finally , audio rendering to enriches text-to-speech output with background noise and reverberation extracted from the original audio. we report and discuss results of a first subjective evaluation of automatic dubbing of excerpts of ted talks from english into italian , which measures the perceived naturalness of automatic dubbing and the relative importance of each proposed enhancement.
