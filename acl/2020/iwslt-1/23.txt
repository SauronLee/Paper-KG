CUNI Neural ASR with Phoneme-Level Intermediate Step for~Non-Native~SLT at IWSLT 2020 | Peter Pol√°k | in this paper , we present our submission to the non-native speech translation task for iwslt 2020. our main contribution is a proposed speech recognition pipeline that consists of an acoustic model and a phoneme-to-grapheme model. as an intermediate representation , we utilize phonemes. we demonstrate that the proposed pipeline surpasses commercially used automatic speech recognition \( asr \) and submit it into the asr track. we complement this asr with off-the-shelf mt systems to take part also in the speech translation track.
