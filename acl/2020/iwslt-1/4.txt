End-to-End Simultaneous Translation System for IWSLT2020 Using Modality Agnostic Meta-Learning | Hou Jeung Han | in this paper , we describe end-to-end simultaneous speech-to-text and text-to-text translation systems submitted to iwslt2020 online translation challenge. the systems are built by adding wait-k and meta-learning approaches to the transformer architecture. the systems are evaluated on different latency regimes. the simultaneous text-to-text translation achieved a bleu score of 26.38 compared to the competition baseline score of 14.17 on the low latency regime \( average latency ≤ 3 \) . the simultaneous speech-to-text system improves the bleu score by 7.7 points over the competition baseline for the low latency regime \( average latency ≤ 1000 \) .
