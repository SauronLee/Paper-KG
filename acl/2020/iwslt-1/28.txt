Neural Simultaneous Speech Translation Using Alignment-Based Chunking | Patrick Wilken | in simultaneous machine translation , the objective is to determine when to produce a partial translation given a continuous stream of source words , with a trade-off between latency and quality. we propose a neural machine translation \( nmt \) model that makes dynamic decisions when to continue feeding on input or generate output words. the model is composed of two main components: one to dynamically decide on ending a source chunk , and another that translates the consumed chunk. we train the components jointly and in a manner consistent with the inference conditions. to generate chunked training data , we propose a method that utilizes word alignment while also preserving enough context. we compare models with bidirectional and unidirectional encoders of different depths , both on real speech and text input. our results on the iwslt 2020 english-to-german task outperform a wait-k baseline by 2.6 to 3.7% bleu absolute.
