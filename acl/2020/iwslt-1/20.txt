NAIST’s Machine Translation Systems for IWSLT 2020 Conversational Speech Translation Task | Ryo Fukuda | this paper describes naist’s nmt system submitted to the iwslt 2020 conversational speech translation task. we focus on the translation disfluent speech transcripts that include asr errors and non-grammatical utterances. we tried a domain adaptation method by transferring the styles of out-of-domain data \( united nations parallel corpus \) to be like in-domain data \( fisher transcripts \) . our system results showed that the nmt model with domain adaptation outperformed a baseline. in addition , slight improvement by the style transfer was observed.
