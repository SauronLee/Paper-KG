End-to-End Offline Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2020 using Modality Agnostic Meta-Learning | Nikhil Kumar Lakumarapu | in this paper , we describe the system submitted to the iwslt 2020 offline speech translation task. we adopt the transformer architecture coupled with the meta-learning approach to build our end-to-end speech-to-text translation \( st \) system. our meta-learning approach tackles the data scarcity of the st task by leveraging the data available from automatic speech recognition \( asr \) and machine translation \( mt \) tasks. the meta-learning approach combined with synthetic data augmentation techniques improves the model performance significantly and achieves bleu scores of 24.58 , 27.51 , and 27.61 on iwslt test 2015 , must-c test , and europarl-st test sets respectively.
