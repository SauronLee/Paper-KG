How Human is Machine Translationese? Comparing Human and Machine Translations of Text and Speech | Yuri Bizzoni | translationese is a phenomenon present in human translations , simultaneous interpreting , and even machine translations. some translationese features tend to appear in simultaneous interpreting with higher frequency than in human text translation , but the reasons for this are unclear. this study analyzes translationese patterns in translation , interpreting , and machine translation outputs in order to explore possible reasons. in our analysis we â€“ \( i \) detail two non-invasive ways of detecting translationese and \( ii \) compare translationese across human and machine translations from text and speech. we find that machine translation shows traces of translationese , but does not reproduce the patterns found in human translation , offering support to the hypothesis that such patterns are due to the model \( human vs machine \) rather than to the data \( written vs spoken \) .
