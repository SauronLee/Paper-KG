OPPOâ€™s Machine Translation System for the IWSLT 2020 Open Domain Translation Task | Qian Zhang | in this paper , we demonstrate our machine translation system applied for the chinese-japanese bidirectional translation task \( aka. open domain translation task \) for the iwslt 2020. our model is based on transformer \( vaswani et al. , 2017 \) , with the help of many popular , widely proved effective data preprocessing and augmentation methods. experiments show that these methods can improve the baseline model steadily and significantly.
