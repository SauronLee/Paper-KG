ELITR Non-Native Speech Translation at IWSLT 2020 | Dominik Macháček | this paper is an elitr system submission for the non-native speech translation task at iwslt 2020. we describe systems for offline asr , real-time asr , and our cascaded approach to offline slt and real-time slt. we select our primary candidates from a pool of pre-existing systems , develop a new end-to-end general asr system , and a hybrid asr trained on non-native speech. the provided small validation set prevents us from carrying out a complex validation , but we submit all the unselected candidates for contrastive evaluation on the test set.
