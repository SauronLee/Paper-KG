The HW-TSC Video Speech Translation System at IWSLT 2020 | Minghan Wang | the paper presents details of our system in the iwslt video speech translation evaluation. the system works in a cascade form , which contains three modules: 1 \) a proprietary asr system. 2 \) a disfluency correction system aims to remove interregnums or other disfluent expressions with a fine-tuned bert and a series of rule-based algorithms. 3 \) an nmt system based on the transformer and trained with massive publicly available corpus.
