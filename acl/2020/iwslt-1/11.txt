LIT Team’s System Description for Japanese-Chinese Machine Translation Task in IWSLT 2020 | Yimeng Zhuang | this paper describes the lit team’s submission to the iwslt2020 open domain translation task , focusing primarily on japanese-to-chinese translation direction. our system is based on the organizers’ baseline system , but we do more works on improving the transform baseline system by elaborate data pre-processing. we manage to obtain significant improvements , and this paper aims to share some data processing experiences in this translation task. large-scale back-translation on monolingual corpus is also investigated. in addition , we also try shared and exclusive word embeddings , compare different granularity of tokens like sub-word level. our japanese-to-chinese translation system achieves a performance of bleu=34.0 and ranks 2nd among all participating systems.
