The University of Helsinki Submission to the IWSLT2020 Offline SpeechTranslation Task | Raúl Vázquez | this paper describes the university of helsinki language technology group’s participation in the iwslt 2020 offline speech translation task , addressing the translation of english audio into german text. in line with this year’s task objective , we train both cascade and end-to-end systems for spoken language translation. we opt for an end-to-end multitasking architecture with shared internal representations and a cascade approach that follows a standard procedure consisting of asr , correction , and mt stages. we also describe the experiments that served as a basis for the submitted systems. our experiments reveal that multitasking training with shared internal representations is not only possible but allows for knowledge-transfer across modalities.
