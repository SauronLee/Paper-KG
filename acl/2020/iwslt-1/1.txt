ON-TRAC Consortium for End-to-End and Simultaneous Speech Translation Challenge Tasks at IWSLT 2020 | Maha Elbayad | this paper describes the on-trac consortium translation systems developed for two challenge tracks featured in the evaluation campaign of iwslt 2020 , offline speech translation and simultaneous speech translation. on-trac consortium is composed of researchers from three french academic laboratories: lia \( avignon université \) , lig \( université grenoble alpes \) , and lium \( le mans université \) . attention-based encoder-decoder models , trained end-to-end , were used for our submissions to the offline speech translation track. our contributions focused on data augmentation and ensembling of multiple models. in the simultaneous speech translation track , we build on transformer-based wait-k models for the text-to-text subtask. for speech-to-text simultaneous translation , we attach a wait-k mt system to a hybrid asr system. we propose an algorithm to control the latency of the asr+mt cascade and achieve a good latency-quality trade-off on both subtasks.
