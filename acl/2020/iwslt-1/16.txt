University of Tsukuba’s Machine Translation System for IWSLT20 Open Domain Translation Task | Hongyi Cui | in this paper , we introduce university of tsukuba’s submission to the iwslt20 open domain translation task. we participate in both chinese→japanese and japanese→chinese directions. for both directions , our machine translation systems are based on the transformer architecture. several techniques are integrated in order to boost the performance of our models: data filtering , large-scale noised training , model ensemble , reranking and postprocessing. consequently , our efforts achieve 33.0 bleu scores for chinese→japanese translation and 32.3 bleu scores for japanese→chinese translation.
