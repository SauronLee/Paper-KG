How to Tame Your Data: Data Augmentation for Dialog State Tracking | Adam Summerville | dialog state tracking \( dst \) is a problem space in which the effective vocabulary is practically limitless. for example , the domain of possible movie titles or restaurant names is bound only by the limits of language. as such , dst systems often encounter out-of-vocabulary words at inference time that were never encountered during training. to combat this issue , we present a targeted data augmentation process , by which a practitioner observes the types of errors made on held-out evaluation data , and then modifies the training data with additional corpora to increase the vocabulary size at training time. using this with a roberta-based transformer architecture , we achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to systems that only mask trouble slots with special tokens. additionally , we present a data-representation scheme for seamlessly retargeting dst architectures to new domains.
