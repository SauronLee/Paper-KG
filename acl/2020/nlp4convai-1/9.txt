From Machine Reading Comprehension to Dialogue State Tracking: Bridging the Gap | Shuyang Gao | dialogue state tracking \( dst \) is at the heart of task-oriented dialogue systems. however , the scarcity of labeled data is an obstacle to building accurate and robust state tracking systems that work across a variety of domains. existing approaches generally require some dialogue data with state information and their ability to generalize to unknown domains is limited. in this paper , we propose using machine reading comprehension \( rc \) in state tracking from two perspectives: model architectures and datasets. we divide the slot types in dialogue state into categorical or extractive to borrow the advantages from both multiple-choice and span-based reading comprehension models. our method achieves near the current state-of-the-art in joint goal accuracy on multiwoz 2.1 given full training data. more importantly , by leveraging machine reading comprehension datasets , our method outperforms the existing approaches by many a large margin in few-shot scenarios when the availability of in-domain data is limited. lastly , even without any state tracking data , i.e. , zero-shot scenario , our proposed approach achieves greater than 90% average slot accuracy in 12 out of 30 slots in multiwoz 2.1.
