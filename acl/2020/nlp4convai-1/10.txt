Improving Slot Filling by Utilizing Contextual Information | Amir Pouran Ben Veyseh | slot filling \( sf \) is one of the sub-tasks of spoken language understanding \( slu \) which aims to extract semantic constituents from a given natural language utterance. it is formulated as a sequence labeling task. recently , it has been shown that contextual information is vital for this task. however , existing models employ contextual information in a restricted manner , e.g. , using self-attention. such methods fail to distinguish the effects of the context on the word representation and the word label. to address this issue , in this paper , we propose a novel method to incorporate the contextual information in two different levels , i.e. , representation level and task-specific \( i.e. , label \) level. our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets on sf show the effectiveness of our model leading to new state-of-the-art results on all three benchmark datasets for the task of sf.
