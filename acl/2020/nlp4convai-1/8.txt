Automating Template Creation for Ranking-Based Dialogue Models | Jingxiang Chen | dialogue response generation models that use template ranking rather than direct sequence generation allow model developers to limit generated responses to pre-approved messages. however , manually creating templates is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. to alleviate this problem , we explore automating the process of creating dialogue templates by using unsupervised methods to cluster historical utterances and selecting representative utterances from each cluster. specifically , we propose an end-to-end model called deep sentence encoder clustering \( dsec \) that uses an auto-encoder structure to jointly learn the utterance representation and construct template clusters. we compare this method to a random baseline that randomly assigns templates to clusters as well as a strong baseline that performs the sentence encoding and the utterance clustering sequentially. to evaluate the performance of the proposed method , we perform an automatic evaluation with two annotated customer service datasets to assess clustering effectiveness , and a human-in-the-loop experiment using a live customer service application to measure the acceptance rate of the generated templates. dsec performs best in the automatic evaluation , beats both the sequential and random baselines on most metrics in the human-in-the-loop experiment , and shows promising results when compared to gold/manually created templates.
