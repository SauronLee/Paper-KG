MultiWOZ 2.2 : A Dialogue Dataset with Additional Annotation Corrections and State Tracking Baselines | Xiaoxue Zang | multiwoz is a well-known task-oriented dialogue dataset containing over 10 , 000 annotated dialogues spanning 8 domains. it is extensively used as a benchmark for dialogue state tracking. however , recent works have reported presence of substantial noise in the dialogue state annotations. multiwoz 2.1 identified and fixed many of these erroneous annotations and user utterances , resulting in an improved version of this dataset. this work introduces multiwoz 2.2 , which is a yet another improved version of this dataset. firstly , we identify and fix dialogue state annotation errors across 17.3% of the utterances on top of multiwoz 2.1. secondly , we redefine the ontology by disallowing vocabularies of slots with a large number of possible values \( e.g. , restaurant name , time of booking \) . in addition , we introduce slot span annotations for these slots to standardize them across recent models , which previously used custom string matching heuristics to generate them. we also benchmark a few state of the art dialogue state tracking models on the corrected dataset to facilitate comparison for future work. in the end , we discuss best practices for dialogue data collection that can help avoid annotation errors.
