Sketch-Fill-A-R: A Persona-Grounded Chit-Chat Generation Framework | Michael Shum | human-like chit-chat conversation requires agents to generate responses that are fluent , engaging and consistent. we propose sketch- fill-a-r , a framework that uses a persona-memory to generate chit-chat responses in three phases. first , it generates dynamic sketch responses with open slots. second , it generates candidate responses by filling slots with parts of its stored persona traits. lastly , it ranks and selects the final response via a language model score. sketch-fill-a-r outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline both quantitatively \( 10-point lower perplexity \) and qualitatively \( preferred by 55% in head-to-head single-turn studies and 20% higher in consistency in multi-turn user studies \) on the persona-chat dataset. finally , we extensively analyze sketch-fill-a-râ€™s responses and human feedback , and show it is more consistent and engaging by using more relevant responses and questions.
