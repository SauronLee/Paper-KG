English-to-Japanese Diverse Translation by Combining Forward and Backward Outputs | Masahiro Kaneko | we introduce our tmu system that is submitted to the 4th workshop on neural generation and translation \( wngt2020 \) to english-to-japanese \( en→ja \) track on simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education \( staple \) shared task. in most cases machine translation systems generate a single output from the input sentence , however , in order to assist language learners in their journey with better and more diverse feedback , it is helpful to create a machine translation system that is able to produce diverse translations of each input sentence. however , creating such systems would require complex modifications in a model to ensure the diversity of outputs. in this paper , we investigated if it is possible to create such systems in a simple way and whether it can produce desired diverse outputs. in particular , we combined the outputs from forward and backward neural translation models \( nmt \) . our system achieved third place in en→ja track , despite adopting only a simple approach.
