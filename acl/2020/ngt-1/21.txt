The JHU Submission to the 2020 Duolingo Shared Task on Simultaneous Translation and Paraphrase for Language Education | Huda Khayrallah | this paper presents the johns hopkins university submission to the 2020 duolingo shared task on simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education \( staple \) . we participated in all five language tasks , placing first in each. our approach involved a language-agnostic pipeline of three components: \( 1 \) building strong machine translation systems on general-domain data , \( 2 \) fine-tuning on duolingo-provided data , and \( 3 \) generating n-best lists which are then filtered with various score-based techniques. in addi- tion to the language-agnostic pipeline , we attempted a number of linguistically-motivated approaches , with , unfortunately , little success. we also find that improving bleu performance of the beam-search generated translation does not necessarily improve on the task metricâ€”weighted macro f1 of an n-best list.
