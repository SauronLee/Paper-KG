Simultaneous Translation and Paraphrase for Language Education | Stephen Mayhew | we present the task of simultaneous translation and paraphrasing for language education \( staple \) . given a prompt in one language , the goal is to generate a diverse set of correct translations that language learners are likely to produce. this is motivated by the need to create and maintain large , high-quality sets of acceptable translations for exercises in a language-learning application , and synthesizes work spanning machine translation , mt evaluation , automatic paraphrasing , and language education technology. we developed a novel corpus with unique properties for five languages \( hungarian , japanese , korean , portuguese , and vietnamese \) , and report on the results of a shared task challenge which attracted 20 teams to solve the task. in our meta-analysis , we focus on three aspects of the resulting systems: external training corpus selection , model architecture and training decisions , and decoding and filtering strategies. we find that strong systems start with a large amount of generic training data , and then fine-tune with in-domain data , sampled according to our provided learner response frequencies.
