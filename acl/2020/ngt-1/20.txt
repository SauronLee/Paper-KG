Generating Diverse Translations via Weighted Fine-tuning and Hypotheses Filtering for the Duolingo STAPLE Task | Sweta Agrawal | this paper describes the university of marylandâ€™s submission to the duolingo shared task on simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education \( staple \) . unlike the standard machine translation task , staple requires generating a set of outputs for a given input sequence , aiming to cover the space of translations produced by language learners. we adapt neural machine translation models to this requirement by \( a \) generating n-best translation hypotheses from a model fine-tuned on learner translations , oversampled to reflect the distribution of learner responses , and \( b \) filtering hypotheses using a feature-rich binary classifier that directly optimizes a close approximation of the official evaluation metric. combination of systems that use these two strategies achieves f1 scores of 53.9% and 52.5% on vietnamese and portuguese , respectively ranking 2nd and 4th on the leaderboard.
