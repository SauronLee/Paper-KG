Findings of the Fourth Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation | Kenneth Heafield | we describe the finding of the fourth workshop on neural generation and translation , held in concert with the annual conference of the association for computational linguistics \( acl 2020 \) . first , we summarize the research trends of papers presented in the proceedings. second , we describe the results of the three shared tasks 1 \) efficient neural machine translation \( nmt \) where participants were tasked with creating nmt systems that are both accurate and efficient , and 2 \) document-level generation and translation \( dgt \) where participants were tasked with developing systems that generate summaries from structured data , potentially with assistance from text in another language and 3 \) staple task: creation of as many possible translations of a given input text. this last shared task was organised by duolingo.
