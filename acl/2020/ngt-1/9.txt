The Unreasonable Volatility of Neural Machine Translation Models | Marzieh Fadaee | recent works have shown that neural machine translation \( nmt \) models achieve impressive performance , however , questions about understanding the behavior of these models remain unanswered. we investigate the unexpected volatility of nmt models where the input is semantically and syntactically correct. we discover that with trivial modifications of source sentences , we can identify cases where
