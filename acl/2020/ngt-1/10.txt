Leveraging Sentence Similarity in Natural Language Generation: Improving Beam Search using Range Voting | Sebastian Borgeaud | we propose a method for natural language generation , choosing the most representative output rather than the most likely output. by viewing the language generation process from the voting theory perspective , we define representativeness using range voting and a similarity measure. the proposed method can be applied when generating from any probabilistic language model , including n-gram models and neural network models. we evaluate different similarity measures on an image captioning task and a machine translation task , and show that our method generates longer and more diverse sentences , providing a solution to the common problem of short outputs being preferred over longer and more informative ones. the generated sentences obtain higher bleu scores , particularly when the beam size is large. we also perform a human evaluation on both tasks and find that the outputs generated using our method are rated higher.
