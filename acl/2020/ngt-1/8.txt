A Generative Approach to Titling and Clustering Wikipedia Sections | Anjalie Field | we evaluate the performance of transformer encoders with various decoders for information organization through a new task: generation of section headings for wikipedia articles. our analysis shows that decoders containing attention mechanisms over the encoder output achieve high-scoring results by generating extractive text. in contrast , a decoder without attention better facilitates semantic encoding and can be used to generate section embeddings. we additionally introduce a new loss function , which further encourages the decoder to generate high-quality embeddings.
