Benchmark and Best Practices for Biomedical Knowledge Graph Embeddings | David Chang | much of biomedical and healthcare data is encoded in discrete , symbolic form such as text and medical codes. there is a wealth of expert-curated biomedical domain knowledge stored in knowledge bases and ontologies , but the lack of reliable methods for learning knowledge representation has limited their usefulness in machine learning applications. while text-based representation learning has significantly improved in recent years through advances in natural language processing , attempts to learn biomedical concept embeddings so far have been lacking. a recent family of models called knowledge graph embeddings have shown promising results on general domain knowledge graphs , and we explore their capabilities in the biomedical domain. we train several state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding models on the snomed-ct knowledge graph , provide a benchmark with comparison to existing methods and in-depth discussion on best practices , and make a case for the importance of leveraging the multi-relational nature of knowledge graphs for learning biomedical knowledge representation. the embeddings , code , and materials will be made available to the community.
