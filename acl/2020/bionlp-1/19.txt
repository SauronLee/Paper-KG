A Data-driven Approach for Noise Reduction in Distantly Supervised Biomedical Relation Extraction | Saadullah Amin | fact triples are a common form of structured knowledge used within the biomedical domain. as the amount of unstructured scientific texts continues to grow , manual annotation of these texts for the task of relation extraction becomes increasingly expensive. distant supervision offers a viable approach to combat this by quickly producing large amounts of labeled , but considerably noisy , data. we aim to reduce such noise by extending an entity-enriched relation classification bert model to the problem of multiple instance learning , and defining a simple data encoding scheme that significantly reduces noise , reaching state-of-the-art performance for distantly-supervised biomedical relation extraction. our approach further encodes knowledge about the direction of relation triples , allowing for increased focus on relation learning by reducing noise and alleviating the need for joint learning with knowledge graph completion.
