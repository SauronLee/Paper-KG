Extensive Error Analysis and a Learning-Based Evaluation of Medical Entity Recognition Systems to Approximate User Experience | Isar Nejadgholi | when comparing entities extracted by a medical entity recognition system with gold standard annotations over a test set , two types of mismatches might occur , label mismatch or span mismatch. here we focus on span mismatch and show that its severity can vary from a serious error to a fully acceptable entity extraction due to the subjectivity of span annotations. for a domain-specific bert-based ner system , we showed that 25% of the errors have the same labels and overlapping span with gold standard entities. we collected expert judgement which shows more than 90% of these mismatches are accepted or partially accepted by the user. using the training set of the ner system , we built a fast and lightweight entity classifier to approximate the user experience of such mismatches through accepting or rejecting them. the decisions made by this classifier are used to calculate a learning-based f-score which is shown to be a better approximation of a forgiving userâ€™s experience than the relaxed f-score. we demonstrated the results of applying the proposed evaluation metric for a variety of deep learning medical entity recognition models trained with two datasets.
