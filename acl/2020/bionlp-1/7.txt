Experimental Evaluation and Development of a Silver-Standard for the MIMIC-III Clinical Coding Dataset | Thomas Searle | clinical coding is currently a labour-intensive , error-prone , but a critical administrative process whereby hospital patient episodes are manually assigned codes by qualified staff from large , standardised taxonomic hierarchies of codes. automating clinical coding has a long history in nlp research and has recently seen novel developments setting new benchmark results. a popular dataset used in this task is mimic-iii , a large database of clinical free text notes and their associated codes amongst other data. we argue for the reconsideration of the validity mimic-iiiâ€™s assigned codes , as mimic-iii has not undergone secondary validation. this work presents an open-source , reproducible experimental methodology for assessing the validity of ehr discharge summaries. we exemplify the methodology with mimic-iii discharge summaries and show the most frequently assigned codes in mimic-iii are undercoded up to 35%.
