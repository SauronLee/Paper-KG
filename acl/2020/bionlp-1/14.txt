BioMRC: A Dataset for Biomedical Machine Reading Comprehension | Dimitris Pappas | we introducebiomrc , a large-scale cloze-style biomedical mrc dataset. care was taken to reduce noise , compared to the previous bioread dataset of pappas et al. \( 2018 \) . experiments show that simple heuristics do not perform well on the new dataset and that two neural mrc models that had been tested on bioread perform much better on biomrc , indicating that the new dataset is indeed less noisy or at least that its task is more feasible. non-expert human performance is also higher on the new dataset compared to bioread , and biomedical experts perform even better. we also introduce a new bert-based mrc model , the best version of which substantially outperforms all other methods tested , reaching or surpassing the accuracy of biomedical experts in some experiments. we make the new dataset available in three different sizes , also releasing our code , and providing a leaderboard.
