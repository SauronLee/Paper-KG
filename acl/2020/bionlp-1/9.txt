Noise Pollution in Hospital Readmission Prediction: Long Document Classification with Reinforcement Learning | Liyan Xu | this paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to extract noise in long clinical documents for the task of readmission prediction after kidney transplant. we face the challenges of developing robust models on a small dataset where each document may consist of over 10k tokens with full of noise including tabular text and task-irrelevant sentences. we first experiment four types of encoders to empirically decide the best document representation , and then apply reinforcement learning to remove noisy text from the long documents , which models the noise extraction process as a sequential decision problem. our results show that the old bag-of-words encoder outperforms deep learning-based encoders on this task , and reinforcement learning is able to improve upon baseline while pruning out 25% text segments. our analysis depicts that reinforcement learning is able to identify both typical noisy tokens and task-specific noisy text.
