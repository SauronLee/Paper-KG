Comparative Analysis of Text Classification Approaches in Electronic Health Records | Aurelie Mascio | text classification tasks which aim at harvesting and/or organizing information from electronic health records are pivotal to support clinical and translational research. however these present specific challenges compared to other classification tasks , notably due to the particular nature of the medical lexicon and language used in clinical records. recent advances in embedding methods have shown promising results for several clinical tasks , yet there is no exhaustive comparison of such approaches with other commonly used word representations and classification models. in this work , we analyse the impact of various word representations , text pre-processing and classification algorithms on the performance of four different text classification tasks. the results show that traditional approaches , when tailored to the specific language and structure of the text inherent to the classification task , can achieve or exceed the performance of more recent ones based on contextual embeddings such as bert.
