Quantifying 60 Years of Gender Bias in Biomedical Research with Word Embeddings | Anthony Rios | gender bias in biomedical research can have an adverse impact on the health of real people. for example , there is evidence that heart disease-related funded research generally focuses on men. health disparities can form between men and at-risk groups of women \( i.e. , elderly and low-income \) if there is not an equal number of heart disease-related studies for both genders. in this paper , we study temporal bias in biomedical research articles by measuring gender differences in word embeddings. specifically , we address multiple questions , including , how has gender bias changed over time in biomedical research , and what health-related concepts are the most biased \? overall , we find that traditional gender stereotypes have reduced over time. however , we also find that the embeddings of many medical conditions are as biased today as they were 60 years ago \( e.g. , concepts related to drug addiction and body dysmorphia \) .
