Global Locality in Biomedical Relation and Event Extraction | Elaheh ShafieiBavani | due to the exponential growth of biomedical literature , event and relation extraction are important tasks in biomedical text mining. most work only focus on relation extraction , and detect a single entity pair mention on a short span of text , which is not ideal due to long sentences that appear in biomedical contexts. we propose an approach to both relation and event extraction , for simultaneously predicting relationships between all mention pairs in a text. we also perform an empirical study to discuss different network setups for this purpose. the best performing model includes a set of multi-head attentions and convolutions , an adaptation of the transformer architecture , which offers self-attention the ability to strengthen dependencies among related elements , and models the interaction between features extracted by multiple attention heads. experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state of the art on a set of benchmark biomedical corpora including bionlp 2009 , 2011 , 2013 and biocreative 2017 shared tasks.
