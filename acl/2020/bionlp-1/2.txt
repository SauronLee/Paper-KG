Interactive Extractive Search over Biomedical Corpora | Hillel Taub Tabib | we present a system that allows life-science researchers to search a linguistically annotated corpus of scientific texts using patterns over dependency graphs , as well as using patterns over token sequences and a powerful variant of boolean keyword queries. in contrast to previous attempts to dependency-based search , we introduce a light-weight query language that does not require the user to know the details of the underlying linguistic representations , and instead to query the corpus by providing an example sentence coupled with simple markup. search is performed at an interactive speed due to efficient linguistic graph-indexing and retrieval engine. this allows for rapid exploration , development and refinement of user queries. we demonstrate the system using example workflows over two corpora: the pubmed corpus including 14 , 446 , 243 pubmed abstracts and the cord-19 dataset , a collection of over 45 , 000 research papers focused on covid-19 research. the system is publicly available at https://allenai.github.io/spike
