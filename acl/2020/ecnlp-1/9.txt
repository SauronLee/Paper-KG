Deep Hierarchical Classification for Category Prediction in E-commerce System | Dehong Gao | in e-commerce system , category prediction is to automatically predict categories of given texts. different from traditional classification where there are no relations between classes , category prediction is reckoned as a standard hierarchical classification problem since categories are usually organized as a hierarchical tree. in this paper , we address hierarchical category prediction. we propose a deep hierarchical classification framework , which incorporates the multi-scale hierarchical information in neural networks and introduces a representation sharing strategy according to the category tree. we also define a novel combined loss function to punish hierarchical prediction losses. the evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in accuracy.
