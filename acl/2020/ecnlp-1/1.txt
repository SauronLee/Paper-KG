How to Grow a (Product) Tree: Personalized Category Suggestions for eCommerce Type-Ahead | Jacopo Tagliabue | in an attempt to balance precision and recall in the search page , leading digital shops have been effectively nudging users into select category facets as early as in the type-ahead suggestions. in this work , we present sessionpath , a novel neural network model that improves facet suggestions on two counts: first , the model is able to leverage session embeddings to provide scalable personalization; second , sessionpath predicts facets by explicitly producing a probability distribution at each node in the taxonomy path. we benchmark sessionpath on two partnering shops against count-based and neural models , and show how business requirements and model behavior can be combined in a principled way.
