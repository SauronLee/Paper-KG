Using Large Pretrained Language Models for Answering User Queries from Product Specifications | Kalyani Roy | while buying a product from the e-commerce websites , customers generally have a plethora of questions. from the perspective of both the e-commerce service provider as well as the customers , there must be an effective question answering system to provide immediate answer to the user queries. while certain questions can only be answered after using the product , there are many questions which can be answered from the product specification itself. our work takes a first step in this direction by finding out the relevant product specifications , that can help answering the user questions. we propose an approach to automatically create a training dataset for this problem. we utilize recently proposed xlnet and bert architectures for this problem and find that they provide much better performance than the siamese model , previously applied for this problem. our model gives a good performance even when trained on one vertical and tested across different verticals.
