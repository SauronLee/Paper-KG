Semi-supervised Category-specific Review Tagging on Indonesian E-Commerce Product Reviews | Meng Sun | product reviews are a huge source of natural language data in e-commerce applications. several millions of customers write reviews regarding a variety of topics. we categorize these topics into two groups as either “category-specific” topics or as “generic” topics that span multiple product categories. while we can use a supervised learning approach to tag review text for generic topics , it is impossible to use supervised approaches to tag category-specific topics due to the sheer number of possible topics for each category. in this paper , we present an approach to tag each review with several product category-specific tags on indonesian language product reviews using a semi-supervised approach. we show that our proposed method can work at scale on real product reviews at tokopedia , a major e-commerce platform in indonesia. manual evaluation shows that the proposed method can efficiently generate category-specific product tags.
