Bootstrapping Named Entity Recognition in E-Commerce with Positive Unlabeled Learning | Hanchu Zhang | in this work , we introduce a bootstrapped , iterative ner model that integrates a pu learning algorithm for recognizing named entities in a low-resource setting. our approach combines dictionary-based labeling with syntactically-informed label expansion to efficiently enrich the seed dictionaries. experimental results on a dataset of manually annotated e-commerce product descriptions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
