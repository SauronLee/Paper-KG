On Application of Bayesian Parametric and Non-parametric Methods for User Cohorting in Product Search | Shashank Gupta | in this paper , we study the applicability of bayesian parametric and non-parametric methods for user clustering in an e-commerce search setting. to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that presents a comparative study of various bayesian clustering methods in the context of product search. specifically , we cluster users based on their topical patterns from their respective product search queries. to evaluate the quality of the clusters formed , we perform a collaborative query recommendation task. our findings indicate that simple parametric model like latent dirichlet allocation \( lda \) outperforms more sophisticated non-parametric methods like distance dependent chinese restaurant process and dirichlet process-based clustering in both tasks.
