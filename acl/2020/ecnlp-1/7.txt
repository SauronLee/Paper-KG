Item-based Collaborative Filtering with BERT | Tian Wang | in e-commerce , recommender systems have become an indispensable part of helping users explore the available inventory. in this work , we present a novel approach for item-based collaborative filtering , by leveraging bert to understand items , and score relevancy between different items. our proposed method could address problems that plague traditional recommender systems such as cold start , and “more of the same” recommended content. we conducted experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset with full cold-start scenario , and the proposed approach significantly outperforms the popular bi-lstm model.
