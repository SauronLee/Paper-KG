Latent Alignment of Procedural Concepts in Multimodal Recipes | Hossein Rajaby Faghihi | we propose a novel alignment mechanism to deal with procedural reasoning on a newly released multimodal qa dataset , named recipeqa. our model is solving the textual cloze task which is a reading comprehension on a recipe containing images and instructions. we exploit the power of attention networks , cross-modal representations , and a latent alignment space between instructions and candidate answers to solve the problem. we introduce constrained max-pooling which refines the max pooling operation on the alignment matrix to impose disjoint constraints among the outputs of the model. our evaluation result indicates a 19% improvement over the baselines.
