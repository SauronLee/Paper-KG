Toward General Scene Graph: Integration of Visual Semantic Knowledge with Entity Synset Alignment | Woo Suk Choi | scene graph is a graph representation that explicitly represents high-level semantic knowledge of an image such as objects , attributes of objects and relationships between objects. various tasks have been proposed for the scene graph , but the problem is that they have a limited vocabulary and biased information due to their own hypothesis. therefore , results of each task are not generalizable and difficult to be applied to other down-stream tasks. in this paper , we propose entity synset alignment \( esa \) , which is a method to create a general scene graph by aligning various semantic knowledge efficiently to solve this bias problem. the esa uses a large-scale lexical database , wordnet and intersection of union \( iou \) to align the object labels in multiple scene graphs/semantic knowledge. in experiment , the integrated scene graph is applied to the image-caption retrieval task as a down-stream task. we confirm that integrating multiple scene graphs helps to get better representations of images.
