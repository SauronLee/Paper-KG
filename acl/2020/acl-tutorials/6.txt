Commonsense Reasoning for Natural Language Processing | Maarten Sap | commonsense knowledge , such as knowing that “bumping into people annoys them” or “rain makes the road slippery” , helps humans navigate everyday situations seamlessly. yet , endowing machines with such human-like commonsense reasoning capabilities has remained an elusive goal of artificial intelligence research for decades. in recent years , commonsense knowledge and reasoning have received renewed attention from the natural language processing \( nlp \) community , yielding exploratory studies in automated commonsense understanding. we organize this tutorial to provide researchers with the critical foundations and recent advances in commonsense representation and reasoning , in the hopes of casting a brighter light on this promising area of future research. in our tutorial , we will \( 1 \) outline the various types of commonsense \( e.g. , physical , social \) , and \( 2 \) discuss techniques to gather and represent commonsense knowledge , while highlighting the challenges specific to this type of knowledge \( e.g. , reporting bias \) . we will then \( 3 \) discuss the types of commonsense knowledge captured by modern nlp systems \( e.g. , large pretrained language models \) , and \( 4 \) present ways to measure systems’ commonsense reasoning abilities. we will finish with \( 5 \) a discussion of various ways in which commonsense reasoning can be used to improve performance on nlp tasks , exemplified by an \( 6 \) interactive session on integrating commonsense into a downstream task.
