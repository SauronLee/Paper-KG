KU-CST at the SIGMORPHON 2020 Task 2 on Unsupervised Morphological Paradigm Completion | Manex Agirrezabal | we present a model for the unsupervised dis- covery of morphological paradigms. the goal of this model is to induce morphological paradigms from the bible \( raw text \) and a list of lemmas. we have created a model that splits each lemma in a stem and a suffix , and then we try to create a plausible suffix list by con- sidering lemma pairs. our model was not able to outperform the official baseline , and there is still room for improvement , but we believe that the ideas presented here are worth considering.
