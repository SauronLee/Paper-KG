Induced Inflection-Set Keyword Search in Speech | Oliver Adams | we investigate the problem of searching for a lexeme-set in speech by searching for its inflectional variants. experimental results indicate how lexeme-set search performance changes with the number of hypothesized inflections , while ablation experiments highlight the relative importance of different components in the lexeme-set search pipeline and the value of using curated inflectional paradigms. we provide a recipe and evaluation set for the community to use as an extrinsic measure of the performance of inflection generation approaches.
