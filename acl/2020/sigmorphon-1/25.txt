Representation Learning for Discovering Phonemic Tone Contours | Bai Li | tone is a prosodic feature used to distinguish words in many languages , some of which are endangered and scarcely documented. in this work , we use unsupervised representation learning to identify probable clusters of syllables that share the same phonemic tone. our method extracts the pitch for each syllable , then trains a convolutional autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional representation for each contour. we then apply the mean shift algorithm to cluster tones in high-density regions of the latent space. furthermore , by feeding the centers of each cluster into the decoder , we produce a prototypical contour that represents each cluster. we apply this method to spoken multi-syllable words in mandarin chinese and cantonese and evaluate how closely our clusters match the ground truth tone categories. finally , we discuss some difficulties with our approach , including contextual tone variation and allophony effects.
