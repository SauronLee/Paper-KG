The SIGMORPHON 2020 Shared Task on Unsupervised Morphological Paradigm Completion | Katharina Kann | in this paper , we describe the findings of the sigmorphon 2020 shared task on unsupervised morphological paradigm completion \( sigmorphon 2020 task 2 \) , a novel task in the field of inflectional morphology. participants were asked to submit systems which take raw text and a list of lemmas as input , and output all inflected forms , i.e. , the entire morphological paradigm , of each lemma. in order to simulate a realistic use case , we first released data for 5 development languages. however , systems were officially evaluated on 9 surprise languages , which were only revealed a few days before the submission deadline. we provided a modular baseline system , which is a pipeline of 4 components. 3 teams submitted a total of 7 systems , but , surprisingly , none of the submitted systems was able to improve over the baseline on average over all 9 test languages. only on 3 languages did a submitted system obtain the best results. this shows that unsupervised morphological paradigm completion is still largely unsolved. we present an analysis here , so that this shared task will ground further research on the topic.
