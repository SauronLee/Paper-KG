SIGMORPHON 2020 Task 0 System Description: ETH ZÃ¼rich Team | Martina Forster | this paper presents our system for the sigmorphon 2020 shared task. we build off of the baseline systems , performing exact inference on models trained on language family data. our systems return the globally best solution under these models. our two systems achieve 80.9% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set. we ultimately find that , in this setting , exact inference does not seem to help or hinder the performance of morphological inflection generators , which stands in contrast to its affect on neural machine translation \( nmt \) models.
