Low-Resource G2P and P2G Conversion with Synthetic Training Data | Bradley Hauer | this paper presents the university of alberta systems and results in the sigmorphon 2020 task 1: multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. following previous sigmorphon shared tasks , we define a low-resource setting with 100 training instances. we experiment with three transduction approaches in both standard and low-resource settings , as well as on the related task of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. we propose a method for synthesizing training data using a combination of diverse models.
