The UniMelb Submission to the SIGMORPHON 2020 Shared Task 0: Typologically Diverse Morphological Inflection | Andreas Scherbakov | the paper describes the university of melbourne’s submission to the sigmorphon 2020 shared task 0: typologically diverse morphological inflection. our team submitted three systems in total , two neural and one non-neural. our analysis of systems’ performance shows positive effects of newly introduced data hallucination technique that we employed in one of neural systems , especially in low-resource scenarios. a non-neural system based on observed inflection patterns shows optimistic results even in its simple implementation \( >75% accuracy for 50% of languages \) . with possible improvement within the same modeling principle , accuracy might grow to values above 90%.
