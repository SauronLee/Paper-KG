The SIGMORPHON 2020 Shared Task on Multilingual Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion | Kyle Gorman | we describe the design and findings of the sigmorphon 2020 shared task on multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. participants were asked to submit systems which take in a sequence of graphemes in a given language as input , then output a sequence of phonemes representing the pronunciation of that grapheme sequence. nine teams submitted a total of 23 systems , at best achieving a 18% relative reduction in word error rate \( macro-averaged over languages \) , versus strong neural sequence-to-sequence baselines. to facilitate error analysis , we publicly release the complete outputs for all systemsâ€”a first for the sigmorphon workshop.
