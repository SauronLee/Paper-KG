Ensemble Self-Training for Low-Resource Languages: Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion and Morphological Inflection | Xiang Yu | we present an iterative data augmentation framework , which trains and searches for an optimal ensemble and simultaneously annotates new training data in a self-training style. we apply this framework on two sigmorphon 2020 shared tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and morphological inflection. with very simple base models in the ensemble , we rank the first and the fourth in these two tasks. we show in the analysis that our system works especially well on low-resource languages.
