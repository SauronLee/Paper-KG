Transliteration for Cross-Lingual Morphological Inflection | Nikitha Murikinati | cross-lingual transfer between typologically related languages has been proven successful for the task of morphological inflection. however , if the languages do not share the same script , current methods yield more modest improvements. we explore the use of transliteration between related languages , as well as grapheme-to-phoneme conversion , as data preprocessing methods in order to alleviate this issue. we experimented with several diverse language pairs , finding that in most cases transliterating the transfer language data into the target one leads to accuracy improvements , even up to 9 percentage points. converting both languages into a shared space like the international phonetic alphabet or the latin alphabet is also beneficial , leading to improvements of up to 16 percentage points.
