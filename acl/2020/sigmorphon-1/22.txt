Evaluating Neural Morphological Taggers for Sanskrit | Ashim Gupta | neural sequence labelling approaches have achieved state of the art results in morphological tagging. we evaluate the efficacy of four standard sequence labelling models on sanskrit , a morphologically rich , fusional indian language. as its label space can theoretically contain more than 40 , 000 labels , systems that explicitly model the internal structure of a label are more suited for the task , because of their ability to generalise to labels not seen during training. we find that although some neural models perform better than others , one of the common causes for error for all of these models is mispredictions due to syncretism.
