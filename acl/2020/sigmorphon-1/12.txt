Frustratingly Easy Multilingual Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion | Nikhil Prabhu | in this paper , we describe two cu-boulder submissions to the sigmorphon 2020 task 1 on multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion \( g2p \) . inspired by the high performance of a standard transformer model \( vaswani et al. , 2017 \) on the task , we improve over this approach by adding two modifications: \( i \) instead of training exclusively on g2p , we additionally create examples for the opposite direction , phoneme-to-grapheme conversion \( p2g \) . we then perform multi-task training on both tasks. \( ii \) we produce ensembles of our models via majority voting. our approaches , though being conceptually simple , result in systems that place 6th and 8th amongst 23 submitted systems , and obtain the best results out of all systems on lithuanian and modern greek , respectively.
