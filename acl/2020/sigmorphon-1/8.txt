The IMSâ€“CUBoulder System for the SIGMORPHON 2020 Shared Task on Unsupervised Morphological Paradigm Completion | Manuel Mager | in this paper , we present the systems of the university of stuttgart ims and the university of colorado boulder \( ims--cuboulder \) for sigmorphon 2020 task 2 on unsupervised morphological paradigm completion \( kann et al. , 2020 \) . the task consists of generating the morphological paradigms of a set of lemmas , given only the lemmas themselves and unlabeled text. our proposed system is a modified version of the baseline introduced together with the task. in particular , we experiment with substituting the inflection generation component with an lstm sequence-to-sequence model and an lstm pointer-generator network. our pointer-generator system obtains the best score of all seven submitted systems on average over all languages , and outperforms the official baseline , which was best overall , on bulgarian and kannada.
