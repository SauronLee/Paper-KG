The NYU-CUBoulder Systems for SIGMORPHON 2020 Task 0 and Task 2 | Assaf Singer | we describe the nyu-cuboulder systems for the sigmorphon 2020 task 0 on typologically diverse morphological inflection and task 2 on unsupervised morphological paradigm completion. the former consists of generating morphological inflections from a lemma and a set of morphosyntactic features describing the target form. the latter requires generating entire paradigms for a set of given lemmas from raw text alone. we model morphological inflection as a sequence-to-sequence problem , where the input is the sequence of the lemma’s characters with morphological tags , and the output is the sequence of the inflected form’s characters. first , we apply a transformer model to the task. second , as inflected forms share most characters with the lemma , we further propose a pointer-generator transformer model to allow easy copying of input characters.
