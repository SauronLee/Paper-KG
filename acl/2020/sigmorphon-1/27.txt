In search of isoglosses: continuous and discrete language embeddings in Slavic historical phonology | Chundra Cathcart | this paper investigates the ability of neural network architectures to effectively learn diachronic phonological generalizations in amultilingual setting. we employ models using three different types of language embedding \( dense , sigmoid , and straight-through \) . we find that the straight-through model out-performs the other two in terms of accuracy , but the sigmoid modelâ€™s language embeddings show the strongest agreement with the traditional subgrouping of the slavic languages. we find that the straight-through model has learned coherent , semi-interpretable information about sound change , and outline directions for future research.
