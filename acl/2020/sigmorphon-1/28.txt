Multi-Tiered Strictly Local Functions | Phillip Burness | tier-based strictly local functions , as they have so far been defined , are equipped with just a single tier. in light of this fact , they are currently incapable of modelling simultaneous phonological processes that would require different tiers. in this paper we consider whether and how we can allow a single function to operate over more than one tier. we conclude that multiple tiers can and should be permitted , but that the relationships between them must be restricted in some way to avoid overgeneration. the particular restriction that we propose comes in two parts. first , each input element is associated with a set of tiers that on their own can fully determine what the element is mapped to. second , the set of tiers associated to a given input element must form a strict superset-subset hierarchy. in this way , we can track multiple , related sources of information when deciding how to process a particular input element. we demonstrate that doing so enables simple and intuitive analyses to otherwise challenging phonological phenomena.
