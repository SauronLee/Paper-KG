Exploring Neural Architectures And Techniques For Typologically Diverse Morphological Inflection | Pratik Jayarao | morphological inflection in low resource languages is critical to augment existing corpora in low resource languages , which can help develop several applications in these languages with very good social impact. we describe our attention-based encoder-decoder approach that we implement using lstms and transformers as the base units. we also describe the ancillary techniques that we experimented with , such as hallucination , language vector injection , sparsemax loss and adversarial language network alongside our approach to select the related language \( s \) for training. we present the results we generated on the constrained as well as unconstrained sigmorphon 2020 dataset \( citation \) . one of the primary goals of our paper was to study the contribution varied components described above towards the performance of our system and perform an analysis on the same.
