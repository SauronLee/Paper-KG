Getting the ##life out of living: How Adequate Are Word-Pieces for Modelling Complex Morphology? | Stav Klein | this work investigates the most basic units that underlie contextualized word embeddings , such as bert â€” the so-called word pieces. in morphologically-rich languages \( mrls \) which exhibit morphological fusion and non-concatenative morphology , the different units of meaning within a word may be fused , intertwined , and cannot be separated linearly. therefore , when using word-pieces in mrls , we must consider that: \( 1 \) a linear segmentation into sub-word units might not capture the full morphological complexity of words; and \( 2 \) representations that leave morphological knowledge on sub-word units inaccessible might negatively affect performance. here we empirically examine the capacity of word-pieces to capture morphology by investigating the task of multi-tagging in modern hebrew , as a proxy to evaluate the underlying segmentation. our results show that , while models trained to predict multi-tags for complete words outperform models tuned to predict the distinct tags of wps , we can improve the wps tag prediction by purposefully constraining the word-pieces to reflect their internal functions. we suggest that linguistically-informed word-pieces schemes , that make the morphological structure explicit , might boost performance for mrls.
